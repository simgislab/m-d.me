## Introduction

An ethnic Buryat and a trained scholar, Tsybikov made a single successful journey to Lhasa between 1899 and 1901, traveling in stages alongside groups of pilgrims. As a highly educated observer, Tsybikov produced the most detailed and methodical account of the journey [Tsybikov, G. Ts., 1919].

Here you can find a map of his travel with a short description. More detailed double-sided map product is [available in Russian](/notes/tsybikov-map/).

The map is based on research into 176 place names (toponyms) located along Tsybikov's route. For each place name, descriptive and cartographic information was sought in literature and cartographic sources to restore the location of the object on the modern map.

## Layers

* Toponyms -- locations and names of geographical features mentioned by Tsybikov. Represented with different symbols depending on the type of feature (city, mountain, monastery, etc.).
* Route -- line of the reconstructed route.
* National borders -- modern borders of Mongolia and China.
* Water features -- Yellow River, Lake Qinghai, and other major bodies of water.
* Terrain -- base layer of the map.

The map also includes an elevation profile along the route. At points every 100 meters along the route, elevation data was taken from the ALOS WorldDem relief model.

## Video demo

Disguised as a Buddhist pilgrim, G. Tsybikov was the first to visit Lhasa in 1901, bringing back its first photographs. These images helped shape National Geographic as we know it today. The reconstruction drew from research into 176 toponyms mentioned in his travelogue.
