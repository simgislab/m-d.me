## PREFACE

UNDER the direction of the famous Russian artist, Nicholas Roerich, a remarkable expedition was conducted for five years through the various countries of central Asia. It penetrated regions where no westerner had been seen for many years; it brought back to the scientific world new knowledge of the history of that region of the “Roof of the World” which is of deep interest geographically and sociologically.

George N. Roerich, orientalist, accompanied his father. Previous to receiving his degree from Harvard, he was brought up in European traditions of culture, studying in the schools of Russia and England, and in France at the School of Oriental Languages, Paris, and at the College de France. Of an exceptionally synthetic tendency of mind, the young scholar has studied Persian and Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese. This extensive knowledge of languages provides him with the key to the mysteries of the “closed land.”

In the country of Tsaidam, George Roerich studied the different dialects of the local Mongol tribes and made the first complete dictionary of them.

From Tibet, George Roerich brings back a scientific picture of the life and civilizations of the nomads of the High Plateau. During his researches he discovered the existence of an artistic style peculiar to the nomads — primarily animalistic — a style closely related to that of the ancient Scythians and Goths. Thus he presents strong arguments in justification of the theory, concerning the ancient civilization of the nomads, whose territory extended from the Gobi Desert and the border of Korea to the lower Danube and the Carpathian Mountains.

x

A most interesting discovery rewarded the efforts of the explorers. On the uplands of Tibet and in the country of the Trans-Himalayas, the expedition carefully studied and photographed many monuments (cromlechs, alinements, menhirs) whose existence had never before been recorded and whose structure evokes most interesting comparisons with our western monuments, especially those of Brittany.

Because of his knowledge of the languages and customs of the countries, George Roerich visited Buddhist monasteries, usually completely forbidden to strangers; he discovered a complete collection of the sacred books of die Bön-po religion, three hundred volumes, which constitute an inesdmable treasure for the history of religions and oriental research.

During these five years. Professor Nicholas Roerich painted nearly five hundred pictures; the collection presents a unique panorama of the least-known regions of the great Asiatic continent.

Through their efforts and their sacrifices, their fortitude in the face of dangers which threatened their lives again and again, and their bravery under attack, the members of the expedition have gready served science, art, and all nations advancing the progress of humanity.

The book which George Roerich dedicated to the scientific results of the expedition marks an important date in the history of Orientalism and represents a contribution of the first order to the conquests of civilization.

## AUTHOR’S NOTE

INNER Asia with its towering mountain ranges and limitless deserts and steppes, a country of great climatic extremes, and the cradle of hardy nomad tribes that once shook the frontiers of China and of the Near Eastern countries, has always been an endless lure to the explorer. In the past a brilliant line of men inaugurated the fight for geographical discoveries in the forbidden lands of Asia. The story of their achievement is one of the most fascinating pages in the history of such explorations. Besides securing valuable scientific information and opening new regions for the progress of humanity, they upheld that spirit of adventure to which our civilization owes its spread. Their example made it possible for others to continue the hazardous task of conquest of distant and unknown lands.

In inner Asia we are able to survey one of the grandest mountain systems of the world; to journey for months across waterless deserts of sand dnd stone and upland plains; and to study the vestiges of a past culture that once linked ancient China with the coiuitries of the Mediterranean basin.

The vast, undrained area of inner Asia is buttressed on the south by the mighty Trans-Himalayas, and the bleak highlands of the successive ranges of the Karakorum. Its northern frontier is formed by the Altai and the mountain chains along the southern rim of the Siberian lowlands. To the east and west this great inner basin is open , toward vast expanses of desert and steppe that comprise the Great Mongolian Gobi and the steppe lands of Russian Turkestan.

This inner region of Asia the Roerich Central Asian Expedition, under the leadership of Professor Nicholas Roerich, traveled and explored for almost five successive years. The chief object of the expedition was to create a pictorial record of lands and peoples of inner Asia; the five hundred paintings by Professor Roerich, brought back by the expedition and now on permanent exhibition in the Roerich Museum at New York, constitute a unique achievement of this purpose.

The second object of the expedition was to survey the possibilities for new archaeological explorations and thus to prepare the way for future enterprises in die same region.

The third object was to secure an extensive collection of ethnographi-

xii

cal and linguistic material, illustrating the culture of these regions. During its long journey along the Tien Shan, the steppe region of Jungaria, the Altai, the mountains of southwestern Mongolia, and the highlands of Tibet, the expedition surveyed numerous archaeological sites; and it is hoped that another expedition may be mustered to carry out extensive excavations of vast necropoli left by nomad tribes, which date back to the period between the &st and eighth centuries a.d. A large collection of Tibetan and Mongolian books was gathered during the expedition’s stay in Mongolia and Tibet.

In sending out this expedition into the field, the Trustees of the Roerich Museum felt the growing necessity of an active American participation in a work which for several decades had attracted the attention of prominent scientists in Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia.

The expedition left New York in May, 1923, and in December of the same year reached Darjeeling in British Sikkim. Here a base was established and several trips were conducted into Sikkim. The whole of 1924 was spent in Sikkim in preparation for the more extensive journey into inner Asia. It was imperative to acquire a good speaking knowledge of the Tibetan language before starting on a journey which would require constant relations with natives. The narrative in the present volume begins with the moment of the expedition’s departure from Darjeeling.

During his five years of active field service with the expedition, the author profited on many occasions by the help and advice of friends and it is a pleasant task to convey his appreciative thanks for the services they so willingly rendered:

To the President and Board of Trustees of the Roerich Museum, for their devoted care and friendly assistance during the expedition’s perilous journey.

To Col. F. M. Bailey, C.I.E., British Political Officer in Tibet, Sikkim, and Bhutan, for his valuable help during the expedition’s stay in Sikkim and on its return from Tibet in 1928.

To Major Gillan, British Consul General at Kashgar, for his active assistance dxiring a most trying period in Khotan.

To His Excellency M. Louis Marin, for his ever helpful assistance and for contributing an introduction to this present volume.

To my teacher. Professor Jacques Bacot, who first introduced me into the ancient lore of Tibet

xiii

To my friend, Dr. Georges G. Chklaver, of the University of Paris, for his untiring interest in my exploration work and his trusted friendship.

To Dr. Johan van Manen, learned Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, who placed at my disposal the resoiurces of the library of the Society at Calcutta.

To Lama Lobzang Mingyur Dorje, my teacher and friend, for his untiring help in my Tibetan studies.

To Malcolm W. Davis, editor of the Yale University Press, in appreciation of his interest in this publication.

Last, but not least, I wish to record my admiration and gratitude to all the European and native members of the Roerich Central Asian Expedition, who unfailingly carried out their duties under most trying conditions.

I dedicate this volume to my Mother and Father, who guided me on the path of exploration and since my boyhood inspired me in the quest for new discoveries and new knowledge.

## KASHMIR-LADAK

### I

KASHMIR-LADAK

ON the sixth of March, 1925, the expedition left the hill station of Darjeeling, and with it the friendly country of Sikkim. It is always a wonderful experience to travel down the jungle-clad slopes of the eastern Himalayas. The tropical vegetation and the endless stream of hill people who wander along the cart road are full of interest to the traveler. In complete darkness, we reached Siliguri. The train was rolling over the low-lying plain of Bengal— jungle-clad and fever-infected marshy tracts, and rice fields already flowed. Through the blackness of the tropical night, one could see the strange life proceeding around the glittering lights of numerous fires scattered in the jungle and in front of small village huts, that stood here and there among palm trees. Figures in white turbans and dhoti moved about, and at the railway stations the air resounded with the high-pitched cries of peddlers selling tea, drinking water, and cigarettes. The country seemed alive with intense movement screened by the dusky veil of the night.

Early in the morning the train rolled into the large station of Sealdah. A traveler who comes from the mountain solitudes of the Himalayas is invariably struck by the semi-European, semi-oriental character of the city. The Calcutta streets, with modern motor cars, horse carriages, rickshaws, cows, and a multicolored crowd of pedestrians, seem indeed to be a stream in which East and West mingle in a striking manner. After a busy and hot day in the great city, including a visit to the headquarters of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, that distinguished institution which is a monument of noble cooperation between western and eastern scholars, we again entrained on the Punjab Mail for the long two days' and two nights' journey across the dusty plains of northern India.

The hot season was already approaching and a peculiar and intense glare hung over the horizon.

On the evening of the eighth of March we reached RawalpindL Several hours before the cantonment, the train traversed an arid country of sand and stone, cut into numerous canyons. After i night spent at a lo-

4 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

cal hotel at Rawalpindi we again resumed our route, but this time in motor cars. Rawalpindi has the atmosphere of alertness of a great military station. Everywhere there are khaki-clad figures; and the town bazaars throng with the colorful crowd of a border country. Fine-looking Hazaras and martial Pathans from the frontier move among the groups of Punjabis and down-country men.

The motor road to Srinagar through Murree has been so often described that I need not dwell too long on this portion of our journey. It is one of the finest motor roads in the world, and the scenery is at times magnificent. Rising gradually, at Murree the road reaches the altitude of some seven thousand feet above sea level.

We spent the night in the resthouse at Garhi, a small village on Kashmir territory at an altitude of 2,628 feet. In the evening we admired the Mohammedan festival of Bakr-Id, when the whole countryside was acclaiming the advent of the spring. Flaming circles of men brandishing torches were moving about the hillside on the opposite river bank, and above them towered the somber silhouettes of the mountains. An unforgettable picture of Indian spring!

Next morning brought us to Uri, a picturesque village and fort situated at an altitude of 4,370 feet. The mountain landscape near Uri was of outstanding beauty; patches of snow intensified the deep blue coloring of the surrounding mountains. After Uri, we passed the ruined temple of Brankutri, similar to the other temples of Kashmir dating back to the Indian Middle Ages. About noon we drove through the small town of Baramulla. The day was beautifully clear and we obtained a fine view of the Nanga Parbat, towering to a height of 26,900 feet.

For the few miles outside of the city of Srinagar, there runs one of the most beautiful drives in the world, bordered with rows of high poplars. All around lies the famous Kashmir Valley, engirded by lofty snowy mountains.

About three o’clock in the afternoon we drove into the native city of Srinagar, and were at once assailed by a motley crowd of Kashmiris, yelling and crying, abusing each other, offering goods: Kashmiri products, houseboats, shikaras, and other attractions of Kashmir. It was a sad sight.

We establidied our headquarters at the Nedou Hotel and at once began our preparation for the journey to Ladak and the desert lands of Chinese Turkestan, lying beyond the lofty passes of the Karakmrum

5 KASHMIR-LADAK

and Sanju. A difficult and long mountain journey necessitates protracted preparations and every detail must be thoroughly checked personally; a journey such as that from Kashmir to Chinese Turkestan over die highest moimtain route in the world, requires unusual forethought and careful consideration. Srinagar is the last place where such preparations can be made and food supplies obtained. The Kashmiri artisans are famed for their work and, if supervised, turn out serviceable equipment. There are a number of native firms in the city which produce excellent winter outfits and camping furniture. Naturally, the traveler must keep a watchful eye on the execution of his order. All the expedition supplies had to be packed in yaghtans or wooden boxes covered with leather. Tin or iron boxes are of no use in mountain travel, for they easily break.

The winter outfit for the cold weather on the mountain passes and the winter in Chinese Turkestan consisted of fur coats lined with *pashmina*, Gilgit fur boots, fur caps, fur socks, and fur sleeping bags. We also ordered several tents of waterproof Willesden canvas with warm pattoo lining. These tents had to be specially constructed to withstand the rough traveling and the mountain gales. They consisted of two flies, the outer fly reaching the ground to prevent the strong wind of the higher uplands from penetrating beneath and lifting the tent. The tent poles were of thick bamboo with strong metal joints, and the tent pegs of galvanized iron.

We also decided to buy our own riding horses in order to be self-equipped and independent of local transport, which is not always reliable. Srinagar is a good horse market, and one can usually get good animals of the Yarkendi or Badakhshani breed. These breeds are famous throughout central Asia and are invaluable on long travels. The Zangskar ponies are good for mountains, but as a rule of uncertain temper and hard-mouthed.

With the kind help of Mr. Nedou, the proprietor of the local hotel, we soon succeeded in buying six fine horses which carried us from Kashmir to the confines of the Altai.

The departure was fixed for the beginning of August, and, meanwhile, we decided to use our free time for a little touring in the Kashmir Valley.

I shall not describe the capital or the valley of Kashmir. Concerning them there is a voluminous literature, and the antiquities of the country

6 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

have been studied and commented upon by such men as Sir Aurel Stein.

Comparing the beauties of nature, and the unique gardens of Nishad and Shalimar laid out by the Great Moguls Akbar and Jehangir with the sad realities of the native city of Srinagar, one is always struck by the deep contrast. We were glad to leave the “Indian Venice” and to feel ourselves again in the open country of the beautiful valley. We hired a large house boat, *The Monarch*, belonging to a sympathetic Kashmiri, Sobra Wanganu, and started for a short trip to Vulur Lake.

The trip along the channels offers little of interest. The boat slowly moves past low-lying banks. The water channels are narrow and the water not always clear. The big lake of Vulur lies engirded by high mountain ranges and in fine weather wonderful shadows play on the mountain sides. We landed at Bandipur, a small village with some commissariat barracks, lying at the head of the Gilgit Road that leads across Gilgit, Hunza, and Sarikol to Kashgar and the Tarim basin. We experienced a violent windstorm on the lake, which broke all the ropes by which the boat was secured to the shore and almost carried it away into the open. The boatmen spent several anxious hours fighting the storm. The house boats are not seagoing and never venture into the open in windy weather. The dunga boat, in which our Chinese interpreter and servants wae staying, had its roof carried away by the wind. Since boatmen considered our position very unsafe, we had to curtail our visit on the lake.

The next day proved to be fine and we had enough time to recross the lake into the channel. The afternoon was stormy again, but we were not affected by it.

About the fifteenth of April, we moved to Gulmarg, the hill station of Kashmir. Here, in the coolness of the mountains, we could conclude our preparations and study the different problems presented by our coming journey. We arrived early in the season and the hill station was still covered by snow. For a whole week we experienced tremendous thunderstorms. The thunder rolled and crashed in the mountains and the ligh tnin g swept round our house in a large circle, illumining the whole neighborho^ at night. For several days we were completely cut off from the outside world and had to keep to our rooms. Nowhere else did we experience electrical storms of such terrific violence. They were usually followed by hail, and some of the hailstones were of surprising size.

7 KASHMIR-LADAK

At Gulmarg we spent the whole of May, June, and July. By the end of July we had received all our outfit and, on the eighth of August, the expedition left Gulmarg for Ganderbal on its long journey to Ladak and Chinese Turkestan.

Ganderbal is conveniently reached by motor cars. It is the starting point of the Ladak Treaty Route. Our caravans consisted of eighty-two pack ponies which were to carry our loads up to Dras on the Ladak side 0^ the Zoji Pass - an alarming number considering the difficulties of obtaining sufficient forage.

We reached Ganderbal late in the evening of the same day, and found our caravan men already camping in the courtyard of the resthouse. Great camp fires illumined the faces of the men and the long rows of caravan animals.

Next morning, August 9, we rose early but were somewhat delayed by the unloading of the supplies from the boats which had carried them from Srinagar. The men were new to caravan work and had to be directed in every detail. Our headman, Wahaba Wanganu, was a cold-blooded and remarkably efficient man who kept the rest of the expedition servants well in hand.

Late in the afternoon the whole caravan moved out of Ganderbal. We drove by motor as far as the little village of Nunner, then moxmted our horses and crossed the Sindh near Wayil. The route follows the right bank of the river for about two miles, and it was a pleasant ride past flowering meadows.

Kangan is a small village with a large bungalow, where we found several other travelers. The route from Kangan to Baltal at the foot of Zoji Pass has been often described, and I shall limit myself to a few comments.

The Leh Treaty Route was made passable for peaceful caravans by the efforts of Colonel Durand’s column in 1891. The Kashmir State takes a great interest in this route, and the transport and supplies are carefully organized. State granaries and spacious serais or resthouses for trading caravans are maintained at various stages along the route.

The route passes Gund and Sonamarg, the summer camping ground of many European visitors. Fine weather accompanied us up to Sonamarg. At Gimd we had a sad experience with our horses which only by a lucky chance did not prove fatal to them. All along the route from Ganderbal to Baltal is a kind of poisonous grass, locally called *gumai*. The horses of the region never touch it, but strange horses often eat it

8 TRAILS TO IMOST ASIA

and perish. Through die negligence of our syces, four of our best horses ate some of this grass and fell ill in the evening. We tried our best to hdp them, but their condition rapidly grew worse. All local remedies were without avail. Finally, we decided to give them a good dose of bicarbonate of soda. This worked wonders. By the next morning all four of the animals were all right and were able to proceed to Sonamarg.

On the road we met the first party of Ladakis on their way to Srinagar. They were dressed in the usual gray homespun — the universal clothing of Tibetan laity. Soon after our arrival at Sonamarg, which is situated at an altitude of some 8,600 feet, it began to rain heavily and continued to do so for the whole night. We had to stay at the dak bungalow for the entire morning, starting only about two o’clock in the afternoon, after the rain had subsided somewhat. Sonamarg, said to be the loveliest spot in Kashmir, did not strike us as a place of exceptional natural beauty. We saw some fine meadows surrounded on all sides with pine forests, but the neighboring moimtains were hidden behind an impenetrable veil of mist and clouds that hovered over the peaks.

The trail was slippery and our pack animals had a hard time on it. After three hours’ march, we reached Baltal, situated amid a birch and pine forest. The bungalow was occupied by visitors from Srinagar, and we preferred to pitch our own camp on a fine meadow outside the resthouse.

The rain started again toward evening and continued for the rest of the night. In the early morning a party of Balti pony men arrived from the pass and reported a landslide there. This bad news m^ant that we would have to stay for the day at Baltal and send up men to clear the road of the dibris. We sent our chief shi\an, Satar Khan, and ten of our pony men out to the pass with spades to repair the trail. Toward noon the rain started again with renewed force and the dismal weather continued until late into the evening. Everything was wet and we had to take the greatest precautions to keep our boxes with food supplies dry. Our men returned toward evening, and reported that the road was elear but that several other places were threatened by avalanches if the rain continued. Luckily for us it stopped toward evening, and by five o’clock in the morning the sky was beautifully clear.

The route from Ganderbal to Baltal runs though a typical Kashmir mountain country with well-watered hillsides, receiving plenty of mois-

ture and covered with luxuriant meadows and pine forests. The great change comes only after the Zoji Pass. We started about six o’clock in the morning and slowly ascended the pass. It presents no difBculty in late summer or autumn. But in winter it is dangerous, and practicable only for men, for its avalanche-swept slopes are covered with ice and snow which may at any time give way and carry the traveler down the precipice. Traffic is closed for the whole of winter and during early spring, dming which time the traveler has to pay special rates to the coolies who agree to iace the peril on the s ummi t of die pass.

The Zoji La route was already known in ancient times. The first mention of the route is made by the Chinese pilgrim Wu-k’ung who visited Kashmir between 751-790 A.D. and mentions the route to Tibet across the Zoji Pass.(1) It has witnessed numerous conflicts in the past. In the fourteenth century came the Turks and shordy after them, the Ladaki Prince Rin-chen, who swept into the Kashmir Valley.(2) In 1532 A.D. the f^ous Mirza Mohammad Haidar entered the valley of Kashmir and successfully fought near the pass. (3)

The Zoji Pass (11,300 feet) possesses another name of Du-shi-la (dus-bshi-la). According to the Rev. Dr. A. H. Francke ,4 the name is a contracted form of the name of the goddess Du-shi lha-mo, the wife of the *siddha* Naropa. According to the popular story related by Dr. Francke, Naropa had to leave her behind because of her Kashmiri smell. The goddess, in disgust, turned her back upon Ladak, and this caused Ladak to dry up and Kashmir to become a verdant valley.

On ascending the pass, the Iwdscape changed completely. We now entered the typical Tibetan mountain country. Barren mountain ridges rose on both sides and between them lay a broad upland plain covered by stone bowlders and scant grazing lands.

At Mitsahoi, on the ninth mile, we stopped for an hour and then resumed our march toward the broad plain on which lies the resthouse of Matayan. The day had become overcast and heavy gray clouds hung over the mountain peaks. The last six miles to Matayan we rode in a pouring rain that made the path slippery, and we were glad to reach die resthouse and camp for the night.

Next day we continued our march to Dras. Passing through the

10 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

small hamlet of Prandes we saw several hirmsteads, surrounded by barley fields, which looked like small strongholds. After an hour’s ride from Prandes, we entered the open valley of Dras.

Dras, properly speaking, is a series of small hamlets scattered over the broad valley watered by the Dras River. The population consists of Dards and Balds.

Near to the bungalow stands the modern Dogra Fort. Ruins of several old strongholds are scattered over the valley and the foot of the hills. The Tibetan name for Dras is Hembabs. The altitude is about 10,000 feet.

For me the chief interest in Dras lay in the Buddhist stone sculptures, found on the roadside outside the villages of Dras. They are four in all and have been described by Sir Alexander Cunningham, who took them to represent female deities, and by Dr. Francke, who correcdy described them in his *Antiquities of Indian Tibet* (5) The first small stone represents a figure of a horseman, probably the portrait of a local raja who erected the two bodhisattva images as recorded in the Sharada inscripdon on the reverse of the stone. The stone next to the first one represents the Bodhisattva Maitreya. The Bodhisattva is represented standing and attired in the princely costume of a rajakumara or royal prince. In his raised right hand he holds a rosary and his left hand supports a vase or bum-pa. On his head he wears the diadem (*mukuta*). Below the principal figure one sees figures of devotees. On the right corner of the stone there is a Sharada inscription, which is unfortunately very much damaged.

I have already noticed elsewhere (6) that the cult of Maitreya was associated with the spread of Mahayana.

The presence of images of the Bodhisattva Maitreya along the caravan route Kashmir-Ladak, and along other caravan routes of central Asia, seems to be significant.

The third stone represents the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara with two attendants. On the stone above the head of one of the attendants, Dr. Francke has discovered a much-damaged inscription.

The fourth stone represents a lotus flower. Dr. Francke dates the images approximately from the tenth century A.D. They have undoubtedly some connection with the spread of Buddhism into the kingdoms of westernmost Tibet and, as such, may belong to the ninth century A.D.

At Dras we had to change our transport. This necessitated long nego-

11 KASHMIR-LADAK

tiations with the local headmen, who had to supply pack animals. Thanks to the excellent organization of the relay service on the route, travelers usually find their transport ready for them. In our case we required at least seventy pack animals — a large number for the scant population along the route. By the evening everything was settled, and pack horses and dzo (a crossbreed between a yak and a cow) began to pour into the dak bungalow’s compound. In the morning we went through the usual “ceremony” of the distribution of our loads by the headmen among the pony drivers. Dark-turbaned men swarmed in the courtyard and the loading was accompanied by the usual loud cries and occasional wrangles. I must credit the Ladakis and Baltis with remarkably quick loading.

Leaving Dras, the trail skirts barley fields fenced by low stone walls, and descends toward the Dras River.

The small hamlet of Dundelthang was the scene of a recent tragedy. An American traveler, Mr. Landon, disappeared here, while on his way to Ladak. His body was subsequently found and buried in the small European cemetery at Leh.

The valley narrows and the path follows the left bank of the river that flows through a fine gorge. We reached Shimsha Kharbu late in the afternoon and camped for the night in the resthouse, pleasantly situated in a garden of willows. Above the bungalow stand the ruins of a castle said to have belonged to Khri Sultan of Sod, a place near Kargil. In Shimsha Kharbu, Ladakis are already more prominent.

In the serai close to the bungalow we found a small caravan of Yarkend traders and some pilgrims from Kashgar on their way to distant Mecca. Since the Great War most of these pilgrims travel across the high passes of the Karakorum, and then through Bombay and by sea. Many die on these journeys, but a great many return to occupy an honored place in their communities.

The next march brought us to the thriving little town of Kargil, the last big settlement in the Dard district. At Kharal there is a good suspension bridge. From here a road branches off to Skardo, and crosses the river, whereas the trail to Kargil follows up the bank of the Sum River.

In Dong-ga, which is situated between Shimsha Kharbu and Chanigund, there is a bowlder with many carvings, representing ibex, afchers, and swastika figures. These stone carvings are widespread over Ladak and the neighboring mountain countries and are found as far as

12 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

the Sanju Oasis on the northern side of the Sanju Pass. They belong to the primitive nature religion of Tibet, usually designated by the name of Bön. (7) The ibex is very popular in the ancient fire cult of the Mongols, and is connected with the idea of fecundity. It seems that these stone carvings belonging to a remote common religious period of inner Asia.

Kargil is situated on a vast plateau. The alluvial slopes that gradually descend toward the river are under irrigation. The town is the capital of the Purig Province, whose population consists of Tibetan stock which has embraced Islam. The streets of the village are thronged with a motley crowd of traders and other visitors to the town market. Sturdy and fair-looking Yarkendis mingle with men from Gilgit and Hunza. Short and squarely built Ladakis, in gray homespun, urge droves of horses and donkeys along the streets. Hawk-nosed Kashmiris, with red flaming beards, bargain with black-turbaned Dards and men from Skardo.

We experienced some trouble in raising the required number of pack animals. A big trading caravan had requisitioned all that were available, and we spent several busy hours in making arrangements. Finally a small caravan of Ladakis was persuaded to hire out their animals for the next stage.

A place of interest in the town is the Dogra Castle, constructed in modern times; another is the Sod Castle, a little north of Kargil, which we had no time to visit.

The next march brought us from Dardistan to Buddhist Ladak. On leaving the town of Kargil, the road crosses a vast sandy plateau. After two hours’ ride, we reached the large village of Pashkyum, the scene of a victorious raid by the Dogras. Beyond the village, the trail enters a narrow gorge of sandstone rocks. The first Buddhists are met at Shar-go-lha (Shar-’go-lha). At this village the valley suddenly widens and a string of *chortens* or *stupas* (shrines) heralds the entrance into the Buddhist kingdom of Ladak.

The village of Shar-go-lha is prominent in local history. According to tradition, one of the ministers of the Tibetan King Srong-btsan-sgam-po, the bLön-po Rig-pa-can, is said to have been born there. His house is still shown situated near the bridge of Shar-go-lha.

Close to the village there is a cave monastery of considerable interest.

7\. The bowlder was reproduced in Francke's *Antiquities of Indian Tibet*, I, 44.

13 KASHMIR-LADAK

According to a local tradition, the monastery was built by two local diiefs, Thog-lde-jo and Yang-lde-jo. (8)

The last three miles of the road from Shar-go-lha to Mulbe passed 
through a country of unusual grandeur. In sharp, bold outlines lie the 
rugged and rocky mountain ridges. The small village of Mulbe clusters 
at the foot of a crag on which stands the small lamasery of Mulbe. We 
spent the night at the resthouse, situated at some distance from the vil- 
lage. . 

Mulbe and its antiquities have been already thoroughly studied and 
investigated by Dr. Francke, an admirable student of west Tibetan an- 
tiquities. His researches are embodied in a learned article, ‘"The Rock 
Inscriptions at Mulbe.”^ 

Mulbe boasts of an old Dard castle, two monasteries, and several im- 
portant inscriptions found on the rock on which one of the monasteries 
is situated. The chief interest of Mulbe consists, however, in a colossal 
stone figure of Maitreya. The image was first noticed and described by 
Moorcroft in i820.^<* It represents the Bodhisattva standing, and is some 
twenty feet in height. The Bodhisattva is attired in the costume of an 
Indian ascetic, with the sacred brahmanical string which serves to dis- 
tinguish bodhisattva images from feminine deities wearing a costume 
similar to that of a Bodhisattva. It is difficult to say anything definite 
about the date of the image. Its purely Indian character is evident, and 
as a work of art it occupies an outstanding place among the stone 
sculptures of Ladak. Local tradition attributes the image to the time of 
the great lotsorwa or translator, Rin-chen-bzang-po (Ratnabhadra 964- 
1054 AJ).). I believe that this must not be far from the truth and that 
the stone image belongs to the tenth or eleventh centuries a.d. The 
lower half of the image is hidden by a small temple or lha-\hang built 
by Wazir Sod-nam, the local landlord. An aged priest officiates in the 
chapel, and offers flower garlands and ghee to the image, before which 
an offering lamp burns on a low altar table. The walls of the chapel are 
decorated with frescoes representing the “eight great sons of Nyewa” 
who are said to have carved the image. The keeper belongs to an old 
family of astrologers and his duty is said to be hereditary in the 
family.** 

From the outside, the image is hidden by trees and the chapel, but

when one enters the edifice, one suddenly sees the colossal statue rising 
before one’s eyes. It makes a lasting and powerful impression on every- 
one who visits the spot. 

From the chapel we went to visit the house of the local landlord who 
had erected the chapel of Maitreya. It is situated a little above the road 
and is a typical Tibetan house, with stables and servants’ quarters on 
the ground floor and the living quarters on the upper floor. We found 
the widow of the landlord in her private chapel where she was offering 
daily prayers for the welfare of the soul of her departed husband. 
Wealthy Tibetan families very often spend considerable sums in 
memory of their departed members. Large donations are presented to 
monasteries, which must pray for the salvation and speedy reincarna- 
tion of the departed. The widow of the late landlord of Mulbe em- 
ployed a lama who spent his days murmuring prayers and rhythmically 
striking his drum. 

The chapel contained some clay and brass images of Sakyamuni, the 
Teacher Padmasambhava, and Tara, the Saviouress, besides several 
photographs representing the abbot or s 1 {u-shol^ of the Hemis Monas- 
tery, the Tashi Lama of Tsang, and the Dalai Lama of Lhasa. 

The housemaids were busy grinding barley and pressing oil on the 
flat roof of the house. 

From the landlord’s house we proceeded up the steep crag to the 
monastery situated on its summit. It is a tiny temple of the usual Ti- 
betan architecture, situated inside a small compound. The lha-\hang is 
in charge of an aged priest. Inside the temple stands an altar with a 
gilded clay image of Padmasambhava. A small library containing the 
sixteen volumes of the Prajnaparamita or ’Bum is placed along the 
walls of the temple. This monastery belongs to the Dug-pa sect of the 
unreformed Nying-ma-pa School of Tibetan Buddhism. 

Returning from the monastery, we examined the inscriptions carved 
on the rock surface. Among them there is an edict promulgated by the 
King ’Bum-lde and a wedding congratulation to King Jamyang (’Jam- 
dbyangs) and his queen. 

We made an early start next day in order to reach the next stage, 
Bod-Kharbu. 

The road leads across the Namike Pass, at an altitude of 13,000 feet; 
the ascent is very gradual and after crossing the pass, the trail leads into 
the valley of Kharbu, interesting for its many ruined castles that crown 
the barren summits of mountain spins. The place was the scene of con- 



KASHMIR-LADAK 


15 

siderable warfare in the reign of King Del-den (bDe-ldan rnam-rgyal, 
1620-40 A.D.). 

The valley bottom is watered by a small rivulet, the Tanjichu, and is 
covered by verdant barley fields carefully fenced with stone inclosures. 
We camped in the resthouse of Bod-Kharbu, a small Ladaki village 
situated at an elevation of some 11,000 feet. On the opposite side of the 
river stand, high on a steep rock, the important ruins of the castle of 
sTag-rtse. A little down the valley to the north lies the old castle of 
Chigtan. The village of Chigtan has also a small lamasery which might 
be assigned to the eleventh century a.d. 

The old town of Kharbu, probably destroyed during the war waged 
by King Del-den rnam-rgyal against the Khri Sultan of Kartse (about 
1620-30 A.D,) lies on the sandstone plateau above the village of Bod- 
Kharbu.** Above the ruined town stands the old castle of Kharbu, also 
in ruins. 

Outside the village in a narrow gorge is situated a small Buddhist 
temple or lha-khang. We found in it an old lama, worshiping several 
clay images, the one in the middle of the altar representing Spyan-ras- 
gzigs Thugs-rje-chen-po, Avalokitesvara, the Merciful Lord. The 
temple possessed no library of its own, except for some prayer manuals. 

The next stage brought us to Lamayuru, the famous monastery on 
the Kashmir-Ladak route. A view of unique grandeur opens before the 
traveler from the summit of the Pho-tho La Pass, 14,000 feet above sea 
level — a. vast amphitheater of rugged mountains, sharp rocks, and dis- 
tant snowy peaks. 

An hour’s ride down the gradually descending slope, and the first 
stupas, standing at the entrance into the narrow gorge, emerge from be- 
hind a low sandy spur. On entering the narrow valley, an amazing 
scene presents itself. High up on steep sandstone rocks stands the pic- 
turesque lamasery of Lamayuru. Chorten and monastic cells cluster in 
the narrow folds of the cliffs. The steep sides of the cliffs are excavated 
with numerous caves used as storerooms and sometimes living quarters 
by the inhabitants of the village. Such cave villages are known to exist 
throughout Tibet and are especially noticeable in the western districts 
of the country. The present village of Lamayuru is situated at the foot 
of the cliffs and a little above the resthouse. 

We spent an extra day at Lamayuru and visited the monastery. At 
present it belongs to the ’Bri-khung-pa sect of Lamaism. According to

the local monastic tradition, it was founded by the famous mahasiddha 
Naropa who lived in the ninth century a.d. and with whose name are 
associated many events in the church history of Ladak. The name of 
the monastery is said to be a corruption of gYung-drung or Svastika, 
the synonym of Bon, i.e., the primitive nature religion of Tibet. Dr. 
Francke relates the following legend about the name of the monastery: 

When Naropa . . . arrived at the site the whole valley was filled with a 
lake which he caused to dry up. The monastery received its name from a 
plantation of sacrificial grain which miraculously grew into the shape of the 
Svastika {gYung-drung). It is interesting that there are traces of deposits of 
a former lake all around the mountains of Lamayuru, and it is strange that 
Drew in his book does not make any mention of them. But the Ladakis 
must really have a geological instinct, to be able to invent stories of this kind. 
They have also tales of the existence of former lakes at Leh and at Triloka- 
nath in Lahul. The name gYung-drung was of course not given by Naropa, 
but must date back to a time long before he arrived in the country, as it was 
then the foremost place of the Bon religion which is called gYung-drung 
B6n.i3 

We visited the du-\hang or assembly hall in which some twenty 
monks were reciting prayers — the library of the monastery containing 
a Kanjiir and Tdnjiir of the Narthang print — and the small courtyard 
in which the religious dances take place. 

The Incarnate Lama of Lamayuru was away, and we were allowed 
to visit his living rooms, which were, as usual, neat and orderly. 

According to the lamas of the monastery, the oldest part of the con- 
vent is the temple called Seng-ge sgang, situated at the southern end of 
the cliff of Lamayuru. The principal image is that of Manjushri or 
Jam-pe yang. According to a local tradition the Seng-ge sgang temple 
dates back to the bKa-gdams period, that is the eleventh century a.d. 
Dr. A. H. Francke, who visited this temple, thinks that the tradition is 
quite in agreement with the general appearance of the temple.*^ 

We also paid a visit to a ruined Bon sanctuary, referred to by Dr. 
Francke.*s Unfortxmately the frescoes that once adorned the walls of 
the edifice were in a very dilapidated condition and one could hardly 
identify the images represented on them. 

On the twenty-third of August we broke camp and started on our 
further journey, hoping to reach the hamlet of Nuria in one day’s 
march.

The trail is rather bad. In several places one has to cross avalanche- 
swept slopes and sand and gravel continuously drift down into the 
stream. Several times we had to cross large accumulations of dSbris — 
traces of a recent avalanche. After three hours’ march we reached the 
open valley of the Indus and crossed the great river by a suspension 
bridge to the important village of Khalatse. 

Khalatse, the old Dard center, is known for its antiquities, and Dr. 
A. H. Francke has recorded most of them*® in several of his articles 
and books. It was formerly a Dard colony, and there still exists here a 
ruined Dard castle. The Ladak king Lha-chen Nag-lug (1150-75 a.d.) 
built the important castle of Brag-nag, whose ruins still tower over the 
village. Dr. Francke has discovered a number of old Kharoshthi, 
Brahmi and Gupta inscriptions, which present many difficulties to the 
decipherer. 

The modern village of Khalatse is pleasantly situated among apricot 
groves. After a brief halt at the village, we continued our march toward 
Nuria (sNyur-la). The trail leads over a stony level ground. The heat 
in midday was intense. We reached sNyur-la in the afternoon and took 
up quarters for the night in the small resthouse of the place. 

The march from sNyur-la to Saspola leads across a barren country 
almost entirely devoid of vegetation. Saspola itself is a large village 
with numerous tree groves. Across the Indus, some two miles distant, 
lies the interesting monastery of Alchi, one of the oldest convents of 
Ladak. This monastery dates back to the time of Rin-chen bzang-po 
(eleventh century) and has preserved much of its old Indian wood- 
carvings which recall the finely executed carvings of medieval Kash- 
mir. In the village of Saspola itself there exist two ruined stupas attrib- 
uted to Rin-chen bzang-po. On the ruined foundation of the largest 
one has been erected a small monastery, named Cham-pa gom-pa 
(Byams-pa dgon-pa). It contains a large image of gilded clay of the 
Bodhisattva Maitreya and several other large images of standing bo- 
dhisattvas. According to local tradition, the standing statue of Maitreya 
was erected by Rin-chen bzang-po himself. Most probably the present 
statue dates from a comparatively recent time and possibly replaced an 
older one, which might have dated from the time of the great trans- 
lator.

TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA 


The next march from Saspola to sNye-mo was interesting for several 
old monasteries. On leaving the village of Saspola, the trail crosses a 
vast sandy plateau. Not far from the route lies the important monastery 
of kLu-dkyil, popularly pronounced Likir. It was founded by King 
Lha-chen rgyal-po {ca. 1050-80 a.d.). The trail descends into the deeper 
valley and reaches the romantically situated hamlet of Basgo, famous 
for one of the oldest monasteries of Ladak and for the ancient palace 
of its kings. 

An old temple, founded by King Thse-dbang rnam-rgyal, contains a 
huge statue of Maitreya, Avalokitesvara, and curious wall frescoes. The 
ancient palace of Ladak kings has a small monastery of Seljang. It con- 
tains a big statue of Bodhisattva Maitreya, said to have been erected by 
King Seng-ge rnam-rgyal about 1610 a.d. It also contains the ancient 
royal library of Ladak. So far as I know, its contents were never thor- 
oughly investigated nor the volumes catalogued. Basgo was the scene 
of considerable fighting when the advancing Mongol troops besieged 
the Ladak king, bDe-legs rnam-rgyal, who reigned between 1640 and 
1680 A.D. 

Basgo, with its half-ruined temples and castles built on precipitous 
cliffs, and the quaint huts of the modern village that cluster between 
the sanctuaries and the sandstone rocks, makes a deep impression on 
the visitor; and I still cherish in my memory the picture of this ancient 
corner of westernmost Tibet. The town is justly said to contain the old- 
est convents of Ladak. 

From Basgo, the trail leads over level stony ground to the collection 
of farmsteads called sNye-mo. The bungalow proved to be occupied by 
a party of Emopeans traveling from Leh, and we preferred to pitch our 
tents in the shady grove outside the bungalow. 

Near to sNye-mo lie the ruins of an old fort called Chung-khar, of 
which only walls remain. 

On the twenty-sixth of August we started at an early hour on the last 
seventeen miles to Leh. 

The track leaves the Indus at sNye-mo and crosses a wide plateau sur- 
rounded by barren mountains. After three hours’ march, we reached 
the village of Phyi-dbang, famous for a monastery built by King Bkra- 
shis rnam-rgyal (1500-1532). The monastery belongs to the ’Bri- 
khung-pa sect and possesses a fine Ihchkjiang or temple. 

About two o’clock in the afternoon we reached the important Yellow 
Hat Monastery of Spi-thug (dPe-thub) built by King ’Bum-lde (fif- 



KASHMIR-LADAK

teenth century) on a steep rock. This monastery was one of the first 
Yellow Hat monasteries of Ladak. It possesses a branch, the Zang-skar 
Monastery, just outside of Leh; and the well-known monastery of Ri- 
dzong (Ri-rdzong) is also connected with it. 

The monastery of Spi-thug enjoys a wide reputation throughout 
Tibet for the austerity of its monks and the learning of its abbot. It 
was erected in honor of the great reformer rje-rin-po-che Tsong-kha-pa 
(1357-1419 A.D.) and a large-sized image of the Saint is found in its 
du~khang or assembly hall. We decided to visit the monastery on our 
way and therefore rode up the steep crag on which it stands. We had 
no difficulty in gaining admission and were very cordially invited in by 
the abbot and his assistant or umdze. We first were shown round the 
du-hjtang where some thirty monks were attending divine service. The 
walls were covered with frescoes, but the extreme darkness inside the 
hall prevented us from seeing much of them. Before the altar glittered 
several rows of offering lamps, whose twinkling light illumined from 
time to time the serene faces of the images. 

We were entertained with tea and sweets in the private apartments of 
the sku-sho\ or Incarnate Lama of the monastery. The s\u-shol{_ himself 
was absent at Ri-dzong, where he was undergoing a course of instruc- 
tion in Buddhist metaphysics. In his absence the monastery was admin- 
istrated by Lama Lobzang, a pleasant old gentleman of quiet manners, 
who made a very good impression on all of us. He was one of those 
erudite lamas who carry in themselves centuries of religious culture. 

The private rooms were neat and well furnished in Tibetan style, 
with painted glass cases containing clay and brass images and a small 
library of religious texts destined for the private use of the s\u-shok. 
His mantle was thrown on his low throne standing at the northern 
wall of the room. After a pleasant hour spent in the company of the 
abbot and his assistant, we climbed to the roof of the monastery and 
enjoyed the magnificent view over the vast and open Indus Valley, 
north of which lies the capital of Ladak. 

The last five miles to Leh led over a stony plain dotted here and there 
with small groves of trees. Leh, with its bazaar engirded by high walls, 
its city gates, the towering mass of the palace, and the picturesque 
crowd that throngs the bazaar and streets, makes a lasting impression. 
It is one of those towns of higher Asia, which has still preserved its 
character of an Asiatic caravan center to which stream numerous cara- 
vans carrying the products of India, China, Tibet, and Turkestan.

TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA 


A careful archaeological study of Ladak requires prolonged residence 
in the country. Whatever we know of the past of the country and its 
monuments of antiquity, we owe to the labors of Dr. A. H. Francke 
and his predecessors in the Moravian Mission. 

Our expedition remained in the capital of Ladak from August 26 to 
September 19, 1925, except for several days spent on a journey to the 
famous Hemis Monastery and other places of interest round the town. 
Much of the time during this stay was occupied by preparations for the 
next difficult portion of the journey across the great mountain route to 
Chinese Turkestan. We had to dismiss all our Kashmiri servants, who 
were quite unsuitable for a hard mountain journey, and engaged new, 
experienced men. The problem of transport also gave much anxiety, for 
it was imperative to get reliable caravan men and good animals. Most 
of the caravans which reached Leh had very poor animals requiring 
several weeks of recuperation. 

After some search and lengthy consultations with the British aqsa- 
qd of Leh, we signed an agreement with Nazar Bai, a Karghalik cara- 
van man, who possessed thirty-six pack horses in good condition. He 
had come in July and his drove of horses had been grazing for two 
months in a garden outside Leh. We needed in all seventy-six pack 
animals to carry the expedition’s baggage, and there still remained 
thirty horses to be found in addition to those we already had. 

Every day we went roimd the serais or resthouses for Yarkend 
traders, inquiring for new arrivals or starting caravans. Finally we suc- 
ceeded in finding the required thirty pack horses, belonging to an 
Afghan trader, Omar Khan, a resident of Yarkend. His horses had 
come only recently from the passes and were in poor condition, but the 
owner promised to feed them well the remaining three weeks and to 
have them fit by the date of departure. We had to agree, for this was the 
only solution of our transport problem. On such a difficult and deserted 
route as the Karakorum trade route, it is always advisable to make use 
of hired transport and not to risk a caravan of purchased animals. The 
difficulties of this mountain route, its rarefied atmospheres and absolute 
barrenness, and the great percentage of caravan animals that perish 
yearly, make traveling very expensive. The prices for one pack horse 
range from sixty rupees to eighty rupees from Leh to Yarkend or Kho- 
tan. We fixed the price of one horse at seventy-six rupees, with the obli- 
gation of carrying the expedition’s baggage in twenty-four days from 
Leh to Khotan.

The caravan men were sturdy Turkis from Karghalik and Khotan, 
in large chapans or coats, soft leather boots or charuq, and large oval 
fur caps protecting the wearer from the bitter winds and gales of the 
highlands. It was strange to hear the strongly guttural sounds of the 
eastern Turki, so different from the soft Urdu of India and the fluent 
speech of Lhasa Tibetans. Some of the men knew a little Chinese, and 
our Chinese interpreter was able to make some sort of conversation 
with them. 

Once the transport problem had been settled, we had more time to 
inspect the interesting locality of Leh and its vicinity. 

The modern city of Leh is situated at the junction of several impor- 
tant central Asian caravan routes, hence its importance for the history 
of the Indian border country. At least three long and difficult routes 
connect Leh with Lhasa, the capital of Tibet proper. The first of them 
crosses the Tibetan uplands and passes north of the great lakes; Ngan- 
tse tsho, Chyaring tsho (Kya-ring tsho), and Nam tsho, the Tengri- 
nor of our maps. It joins the great Mongolia-Lhasa route in the impor- 
tant frontier center of Nag-chu dzong (a Tibetan dzong is the admin- 
istrative center of a district and not a fortress, as is often recorded). 

The second of the three routes crosses the Tibetan upland to the holy 
Kailasa Range and strikes south of the Great Lakes: Dangra yum-tsho, 
Ngan-tse, and Tengri-nor. Travelers by this route travel direct to Lhasa 
across the high pass of Go-ring La in the Nyen-chen Thang La Range. 

The third route follows the course of the Brahmaputra and passes 
through Saga dzong, north of the river. From here it strikes either 
along the bank of the Brahmaputra to Lhartse dzong, or crosses the 
river and passes through Tingri on the Nepal border. In both cases the 
route runs through Shigatse to Lhasa. This last route is used by most of 
the Ladaki traders traveling to Lhasa and by the Embassy from the 
Maharaja of Kashmir to the Court of Lhasa. 

The Karakorum route, aptly called the highest trade route in the 
world, connects Leh with distant China and the oases of Chinese Tur- 
kestan. Traders from Yarkend, Kashgar, and Khotan, the principal 
oases of southwestern Chinese Turkestan, follow it on their way to 
India. From Leh the central Asian caravans travel to Kashmir across 
the Zoji La, or through Zangskar, Lahul, the valley of Kulu and the 
native states of Mandi to Hoshiarpur and Amritsar, the two great em- 
poriums of Punjab. This Turkestan trade route has increased greatly in 
importance during the last ten years, and the Government of India has 



22 


TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA 


facilitated by several measures the passage of trading caravans over In- 
dian territory. With the closing of the Russian frontier and the recent 
txnrest and civil war in western China, the Turkestan trade turned 
southward to India, and we found the route alive with caravan parties 
which were braving the icy winds and frequent avalanches on the 
mountain crests. 

Such a favorable situation makes Leh an exceedingly interesting 
place for archaeological and ethnographical research. The two principal 
bazaars of the town are thronged by a multicolored crowd, among 
which the neatly attired Turkestan Turks are prominent. Huge bales 
of merchandise, containing Turkestan felts or nimdah, which come 
from Khotan, Guma, and Yarkend and command good prices on In- 
dian markets, stand in front of the open shops. Some of these felts are 
very decorative in design and, as products, arc much superior to similar 
felts made by the Mongols or even the Chinese. In camp they are indis- 
pensable, for they serve as floor covering for tents and as bedding for 
the personnel of the caravans. Quite recently the export of these felts 
from Turkestan to India greatly increased, and this reacted favorably 
on the ancient industry. 

The Tibetan nomads of the north bring the soft Tibetan wool out of 
which Kashmiri artisans make their beautiful pashmina shawls. 

The caravans from Turkestan arrive usually in July and August and 
start on their return journey in October or even November, before the 
snow has closed the passes for the winter. The merchandise brought to 
Leh and Kashmir consists chiefly of Turkestan felts, Chinese and Kho- 
tancse silks, furs, wool, and leather products such as the Turkestan top 
boots and charuqs, valued so highly by the Ladaki caravan men. A con- 
siderable trade is done in horses, and Yarkend caravans usually bring 
with them a good number of riding horses which they drive unloaded 
across the passes. The hardy and swift Turkestan horse is greatly appre- 
ciated in Kashmir and the plains of India, which have never produced 
a country horse of its own. 

The returning caravans carry loads of European-made goods: prod- 
ucts of Manchester looms and Bradford woolen mills, British and Ger- 
man dyestuffs, various articles of haberdashery, and Indian products 
and spices, such as saffron, which is exported in great quantities from 
Kashmir to Turkestan and Tibet. 

All this motley crowd of visitors moves, shouts, and gesticulates in 
the narrow streets and bazaars of Leh. Sitting on the verandah of the 



KASHMIR-LADAK 


23 

dak bungalow one constantly hears the pleasant bells of passing cara- 
vans and the songs of the Ladaki women and men carrying grass from 
the fields. At times this continuous flow of men and beasts will sud- 
denly be interrupted by the trampling of a drove of horses driven by 
mounted herdsmen. 

In some corners of the bazaars, or in the vicinity of Lamaist temples, 
one meets red-clad lamas who have traveled hundreds of miles from 
inner Tibet, selling holy relics and talismans. Curiously enough I have 
seen Buddhist talismans or srung-wa on Turki caravan men from 
Karghalik who seemed to be quite convinced of their potency. The 
black and blue turbaned Baltis are very prominent in the streets of Leh 
and usually find employment as coolies or caravan men, carrying heavy 
loads. Occasionally one meets the quaint figures of the Mons, preservers 
of the ancient Ladaki lore and probably an ethnic remnant of a primi- 
tive population, which has been submerged by subsequent waves of 
foreign migrations. 

During our stay in Leh, we made the acquaintance of the son of the 
Ladaki aqsaqal of Lhasa, a young fellow of considerable acumen, who 
was on a summer visit to Leh. The goods that he brought consisted of 
brick tea, Tibetan cloth puru, lama boots manufactured at Dre-pung, 
and other objects of the Lamaist cult. He even had several Tibetan 
xylographs for sale, prominent among which was the life story or nam- 
thar of Je-tsiin Milarepa, Tibet’s great ascetic and poet of the eleventh 
century a.d. 

Wandering through the streets of Leh, one feels the beating pulse of 
the great Asia that lies hidden behind the veil of a superficial moderni- 
zation. 

The native Ladaki population is chiefly agricultural, and numerous 
farmsteads and villages lie along the Indus Valley and the vast sandy 
plain on which Leh is situated. In this mountainous country agriculture 
is possible only in the river valleys and is seldom carried on above an 
altitude of 12,000 feet. The scarcity of arable land, mostly represented 
by fluvial fans and river terraces, has limited the agricultural popula- 
tion to a few river valleys. 

Leh, which is sometimes spelled sLel or sLes, became the permanent 
residence of the kings of Ladak from the time of the reign of King 
’Bum-lde (fifteenth century a.d.). The antiquities of Leh consist of 
payees, stupas, and temples, stone carved images, and ancient graves. 

When one approaches the town of Leh, one perceives from afar the 



24 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA 

towering white mass of its great palace, erected about 1620 aj>. by King 
Seng'ge mam-rgyal, one of the greatest builders of Ladak; he was as- 
sisted in his work by the Lama sTag-tshang ras-chen, whom he invited 
to his court.^7 The palace dominates the city, and the houses that cluster 
round it seem like stone steps leading toward an imposing edifice or 
altar. The Leh Palace is said to have been built on the model of the 
great Potala Palace of Lhasa, and indeed there is a slight resemblance, 
between these two monuments of the Tibetan past. We had the good 
fortune of passing several days at the Palace of Leh through the cour- 
tesy of the present Raja of Ladak. 

A broad road, on either side of which rise low walls of unhewn 
stones, leads to the famous Lion Gate of the King’s Palace. Painted 
wooden columns support the roof of the entrance. A large stone stair- 
way leads to the upper rooms of the Palace. It is in a very dilapidated 
condition and some of the stones forming the steps have rolled down. 
One has to advance carefully, testing the firmness of the stones. Our 
servants called it "Sasseri,” comparing the stairway to the difficult 
mountain trail leading toward the Sasser Pass on the Karakorum route. 
To the right and left of the stairway gape dark holes in the walls— -for- 
mer doors leading to the storerooms or servant quarters. After one has 
climbed to the upper floor, a flash of bright light suddenly pierces the 
darkness of the corridor — ^it is a side window without a wooden frame 
or glass, just a square hole in the wall; climbing the stairway in com- 
plete darkness at night one has to be very careful not to fall out of this 
window. A little farther on, one enters a vast hall with an earthen floor. 
Round the walls stretches a kind of portico supported by wooden col- 
tunns, painted in bright colors and carved. The walls are adorned with 
numerous images of the green Tara. From here a few stone steps lead 
to the next floor, where the living quarters are situated. These are typi- 
cal Tibetan rooms with wooden frames in the large square windows 
and carved columns that support the ceiling. The doors are massive, 
with huge iron keys and iron plaques that serve as ornaments. From 
one of the rooms a passage leads to the roof of the Palace, from which 
opens a unique view of the city lying at the foot of the Palace, the 
snowy peaks of the mountain range on the southern side of the Indus 
Valley, and the wind-swept ridge of the Khardong La over which 
hover light clouds, the messengers of approaching storm.

At sunset, the whole of the sandy plain and the sand rock mountains 
that rise on either side of it light up with an intense glow. The town 
below plunges into a deep violet mist and the rows of white stupas on 
the plain sparkle like necklaces of precious stones. During this hour the 
Ladaki men and women tell their evening prayers, and incense smoke 
rises slowly above every house on the plain. It is during this hour of 
peace and prayer that the visitor to the capital of the little kingdom be- 
gins to understand the intrinsic beauty of the country and the irresist- 
ible force of attraction it exercises on its sons. 

From the roof of the Palace one descends by another stairway to the 
small royal chapel of the Palace. An officiating priest guards the sacred 
images and lights the offering lamps of the altar. The principal figure 
is that of Dug-kar, the Saviouress. The figure is the work of a Ladak 
artist, who has acquitted himself of his task with considerable success. 
The thousand-armed goddess holds numerous symbols that reveal to 
the devotee the omnipotent nature of the deity. Round the walls of the 
small chapel hang numerous banners, some of which seem to be old 
and are extremely interesting on account of their style. As Ladak is 
situated at the junction of several highways of Asia, its art and culture 
bear an imprint of cosmopolitanism. Some of the painted banners 
evince a decisive Indo-Persian style, and many of the details seem to be 
taken from a Mogul miniature. Others again strongly remind one of 
the great pictorial compositions of Chinese Turkestan. We spent con- 
siderable time studying the many painted banners under the flickering 
light of a candle, for it seemed a profanation to disturb the somber 
chapel with the bright and sharp light of a flashlight. 

Unfortunately the Palace was not the ideal quarter for an expedition 
with hundreds of cases and bales, which need packing and distribution 
into pony loads. After several days spent in the fantastic surroundings 
of the ancient abode of Ladaki kings, we were obliged to return to our 
former headquarters at the dak bungalow, where we had plenty of 
space to arrange the pony loads and keep our saddle horses. 

The oldest palace of Leh is situated on the steep rock rNam-rj^al 
rtse-mo behind the town, and is said to have been erected by King 
bKra-shis rnam-rgyal {ca. 1520 aj).). Now only ruins remain of this 
ancient structure, and some of its walls have been used for the construc- 
tion of the present monastery on the hill. 

Below the hill lies the small hamlet of Chubi, which was founded by 
tl^e same bKra-shis rnam-rgyal.

TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA 


The present Raja of Ladak dwells in his summer residence at sTog. 
He receives a small annual pension and leads a retired life. He seldom 
visits the town and resides in his great town palace only during the 
New Year feftivities. His aged father has embraced monkhood and de- 
votes his life to religious work. He is a serene and dignified gentleman, 
learned in the sacred lore of his country. When he paces down the 
streets of Leh on his rare visits to the town, many of the people throw 
themselves down before him and thus greet the scion of the ancient 
house of Kesar. 

The temples and monasteries of Leh are prominent features of the 
town itself and its neighborhood. The oldest temple is situated on the 
rNam-rgyal rtse-mo Hill and is dedicated to Maitreya. According to tra- 
dition it was built by King ’Bum-lde.*® On the same hill is foimd the 
interesting temple called mGon-khang and dedicated to the Lords or 
Dharmapalas of the Four Quarters. It was erected by King bKra-shis 
rnam-rgyal, the builder of the Palace on the same hill, and of the ham- 
let Chubi. The temple contains frescoes whose importance is enhanced 
by the fact that their dates may be given. In the history of Tibetan picto- 
rial art we are sadly lacking in definite dates to fix the different periods 
of the artistic evolution of the country. We speak of the different for- 
eign influences which affected the art of Tibet, but are unable to place 
them in time. Therefore it is always gratifying to find frescoes or paint- 
ings which can be definitely dated. I hope to devote a separate work to 
the wall paintings found in Tibetan monasteries; like everything in 
Ladak, they evince a strong composite nature, and the artist or artists 
who executed them were inspired not only by the canonical art of 
Tibet but were also strongly influenced by the secular art of neighbor- 
ing countries. Very striking is the fresco representing the family of 
Ladak kings. The men are attired in Mogul fashion, but the queens 
are depicted wearing the national Ladak dress. The fresco shows the 
duality that still exists in the culture of present-day Ladak. 

Below the royal palace of Seng-ge rnam-rgyal stand two temples — 
one consecrated to the future Buddha Maitreya, the other to Avalokites- 
vara, the Divine Patron of Tibet. The temple or lha-\hang of Maitreya, 
besides containing a huge image of the Future Buddha, has old and in- 
teresting frescoes. One of them represents the Meditative or Dhyani- 
Buddhas wearing the princely attire of bodhisattvas. Close to these 
temples lie the ruins of the house of a former minister of Ladak {bKa-

blon). Old clay images and manuscript books are still to be found in 
the ruins. 

North of Leh is situated the small monastery of Zangskar, a branch 
of the Spi-thug Monastery. It is of comparatively recent date but con- 
tains some well-executed images and frescoes. A square courtyard 
paved with large slabs of stone leads to the chief temple, standing in 
front of the entrance gate. The first room of the temple contains a clay 
image of Avalokitesvara, the Merciful Lord. The walls of the temple 
are covered with modern frescoes of fine execution, painted by a well- 
known Ladak artist, now an old man residing at the Trikshe Monas- 
tery. Behind the first hall is situated a small chapel consecrated to the 
worship of Dug-kar. Besides the goddess’ image we found a large im- 
age of Manjushri or Jam-pe yang, the Prince of Knowledge. The rest of 
the monastery buildings in the courtyard are occupied by cells and 
storerooms. 

A place well-worth visiting is the town residence of the Hemis sl{u- 
sho\ or abbot of the well-known Hemis Monastery. It is in charge of a 
nyer-wa or housekeeper. The s\u-sho\ only seldom resides in it and 
most of the year the house stands empty. It is a typical Tibetan man- 
sion, and the upper rooms command a fine view of the Indus Valley 
and the snowy mountains beyond it. As usual the ground floor is re- 
served for stables, servants’ quarters, and storerooms. On the second 
floor is situated the kitchen, a cleanly kept place with huge shining 
brass cauldrons and other kitchen utensils. The living quarters are on 
the upper floor. These are airy rooms with large square windows. Only 
one room had glass in the windows, the other had beautifully carved 
window frames but neither glass nor paper. 

Some of the private houses of Leh contain interesting frescoes in the 
living rooms. In one such house I remember having seen frescoes illus- 
trating the life of Je-tsun Milarepa, his encounter with the Bon magi- 
cian Naropa on the holy Kailasa Mountain, and other equally famous 
episodes of the Saint’s life. The same room had another very curious 
fresco representing the Emperor of China and the arrival of a Ladaki 
embassy to the Imperial Court of China. Unfortunately there was no 
inscription to explain or date the painting. The owner of the house 
called the fresco rGyn-nag-gi kpng-ma chen-po, i.e., “The Emperor of 
China.” It is the second historical fresco which I found in Ladak. No 
doubt there exist others. The art of fresco painting is still cultivated in 
ISadak and the Ladaki artists produce sometimes works -of art which 



28 


TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA 


compare favorably to those of the central Tibetan school, with its ri' 
gidity of composition and design. 

In the village of Changspa, situated in the vicinity of Leh, Dr. 
Francke has discovered interesting frescoes illustrating one of the impor- 
tant episodes of the Kesar Saga. The wall paintings are found in the 
summer residence of a family of bKa-blon or ministers. They represent 
the war of Jang or IJang-dmag, a country in the east of Tibet against 
which King Kesar waged war. Kesar frescoes are extremely rare 
throughout Tibet, and it is gratifying to know that Dr. Francke had 
those of Changspa copied. 

The capital of Ladak abounds in stupas, mani-y/dXXs or men-dongs, 
and stone-cut images. On the large plain outside Leh stands the longest 
wfl«/-wall of the country, with large stupas on its extremities. It was 
built by King Del-dan rnam-rgyal (1620-40 a.d.). The Ladak stupas 
are characterized by painted stucco figures on their foundations. Some- 
times these represent winged horses, lions, peacocks, or swans. Rock- 
cut images abound in Leh and along the trails that lead to the town. At 
the village of Changspa are found two important stone images, one 
representing the Buddha Sakyamuni and the other the Future Buddha. 
Sakyamuni is depicted standing with both hands making the sign of 
instruction {dharmaca\ra~mudrd). The Buddha is assisted by Mai- 
treya and Padmapani, represented on either side of the chief figure. 
The second figure represents Maitreya holding the rosary and the vase 
or bum-pa. It is interesting to note that the Ladak images of Maitreya 
all hold the rosary in the right hand, instead of the stalk of the lotus 
flower, as is the case on central Tibetan bronzes. The rosary seems to 
belong to an older tradition. On the route to Khardong Pass stands a 
stone image of Maitreya holding the rosary in his right hand and the 
vase in his left. 

A separate and curious group of monuments is formed by the Mal- 
tese crosses with inscriptions found in the vicinity of Drang-tse, a vil- 
lage on the Pangkong Lake. The inscriptions accompanying the cross 
figures were recognized to be Soghdian. It remains to be determined 
during what period these crosses were erected and the reason that they 
are found in such a remote place as Drang-tse on the Pangkong-tsho. It 
seems very probable that there existed a floating Nestorian Christian 
population in Ladak during the eighth to tenth centuries a.d. when 
Nestorian colonies were numerous along the trade routes of Turkestan, 
and other regions of central Asia. Whether the Nestorian visitors \o 



KASHMIR-LADAK 


29 

Ladak were merchants or pilgrims, it is impossible to determine at 
present. In the country round Ladak and Kashmir are found curious 
legends of a Christian character, which are at present current among 
the Mohammedan population of the two provinces. They may be rem- 
nants of a Nestorian past. The Nestorian Christians were known all 
over central Asia under the name of drkagun-arghun, and it is interest- 
ing to note that the half-caste population of Ladak, born of a Turki 
father and a Ladaki mother, is designated by the same word pro- 
nounced arghunJ9 The Nestorians were known in the Mongol Empire 
under the name of Tarsa and Arkagun. The origin of drkflgiin is diffi- 
cult to establish. 

Islam is served in Leh by the large mosque at the upper end of the 
bazaar. It was probably erected after Nawab Fatehkhan’s march to 
Ladak. 

Several of the so-called ancient Dard graves at Teu-gser-po, a place 
about two miles above the British Joint-Commissioner’s bungalow, 
have been excavated by the missionaries, and were found to contain low 
masonry walls of unhewn stones, somewhat like a subterranean cham- 
ber, handmade pottery with linear ornaments, and small bronze ob- 
jects, beads, etc. Some of the pots were filled with human bones. This 
fact seems to indicate that the people who built these graves were in the 
habit of cutting up the body and depositing the bones and flesh in jars. 

It is as yet impossible to determine what people constructed the Leh 
graves. Dr. Francke believes them to have been Dards.*° All the skulls 
so far discovered were distinctly dolichocephalic, whereas modern Ti- 
betans of Ladak are brachycephalic. The Tibetans are a composite race, 
and I have collected during my stay among the nomads of Tibet a 
number of facts which show that there once existed an ancient stratum 
of dolichocephalic population in Tibet. The nomad tribes of the Ti- 
betan border country still show dolichocephalic and brachycephalic in- 
dexes. The results of my investigations can be summarized thus: the 
Hor-pas of the Thang La region — mostly dolichocephalic; the Panags, 
Goloks, and Nya-rong-was — numerous dolichocephalic skulls, the same 
being true of the Northern Kham Province; the Chang-pas of the lake 
region — ^mostly brachycephalic indexes, some showing a transitional 
type; the agricultural population of the Brahmaputra Valley and south- 
eastern Tibet — ^mostly brachycephalic indexes. It is clear from the above

20. Ibid., I, 68 II. 



TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA 


30 

that the dolichocephalic population had been preserved along the Ti- 
betan border, whereas the center of the country had been conquered 
at some early date by a brachycephalic race. I am inclined to think that 
the graves at Teu-gscr-po were left by the ancient stratum of dolichoce- 
phalic tribes of Tibet. It is interesting to note that the Leh graves are 
popularly called “nomad graves,” and it is precisely among the nomad 
population that we find the dolichocephalic type with fine features and 
straight hair. Unfortunately the missionaries were obliged to stop their 
excavations and a great many of these graves are still unexplored. It 
will be very instructive to compare the Ladak graves to the analogous 
graves foimd in the lake region north of the Trans-Himalayas. 

The famous Hemis Monastery has often been described in books 
about the country, and the religious dances that take place at the mon- 
astery about the end of June have been attended by many Europeans. 
Although of comparatively recent date, the monastery contains some 
old bronzes. The frescoes in the temples are modern, and as such have 
only an iconographical value. 

The road along the Indus Valley is extremely picturesque. The vivid 
green of its fields appears in sharp contrast to the ruggedness of its 
mountains. The village of Shel on the right bank of the river was once 
the capital of the Ladak Kingdom and is notable for ancient rock in- 
scriptions and stone-cut images. The Yellow Hat Monastery of Tik-tse 
(Khrig-rtse), situated on a steep crag, is interesting for its romantic 
situation, but it looks forlorn. It is populated by a crowd of dirty and 
insolent monks, who impudently clamor for bahjhish and lack' the dis- 
cipline and monastic dignity found in their colleagues of Spi-thug and 
Ri-dzong. The Incarnate Lama was obliged to quit the monastery some 
years ago, for monastic life possessed no attractions for him. A new in- 
carnation did not appear, and the whole establishment was left to itself. 
We succeeded in finding some old bronzes and several old painted ban- 
ners. Some of the temple doors had interesting wood carvings. The 
colossal figure of the Future Buddha, lit by numerous offering lamps, 
made a powerful impression; but the heaps of rubbish in the corners of 
the edifice and the thick layer of dust on objects of worship only en- 
hanced the first sense of the forlorn state of the monastery. No doubt 
many interesting objects could be found, but the state of utter disor- 
ganization prevents the student from making a careful inspection of 
the monastery buildings. 

The autumn was rapidly setting in. Yellow leaves in the gardens ana

the frequent breaths of cold wind from the mountain summits made us 
realize that it was advisable to hurry our departure. For several days the 
town had been filled with reports that snowstorms were beginning on 
the high passes and our caravan'^<;r^/r pressed us to start before the early 
snow would block the passes. Professor Roerich had completed his se- 
ries of paintings on Ladak and its sanctuaries, and we could begin our 
final preparations for the difficult journey ahead of us. We were short 
of men, and it seemed very difficult to engage suitable ones for the long 
journey to Khotan. We sent a notice to the bazaars that men were 
needed, and daily crowds of them came to the dak bungalow. Out of 
this motley collection of Baltis, Ladakis, Kashmiris, Arghuns, and 
Turkis, Mrs. Roerich chose several promising men, who proved very 
helpful on our track to Chinese Turkestan. Two of them had the dis- 
tinction of serving under Dr. Sven Hedin during his expedition of ' 
1907-8, and several others had been previously employed as caravan 
men on the Karakorum route. They all knew the way well and were 
fully prepared to face the difficulties and dangers of the mountain jour- 
ney. Most of them had been several times in Yarkend or Khotan and 
spoke fluently the eastern Turki. We engaged them as far as Khotan 
and promised to pay their journey home. Besides his pay each of the 
men received a warm fur coat, a winter fur cap, and a pair of soft 
charuq boots with felt socks. Two tents were provided to shelter the 
personnel of the expedition during the night, but for the whole of the 
journey many of the men preferred to sleep in the open or under the 
flies of our own tents. 

The son of a local Ladak headman was accompanying us as head 
servant and proved a devoted and efficient man. Ladakis are wonderful 
in caravans, always cheerful amid hardships and storms, contented 
with little, and always ready to perform their work. They march on 
foot long distances over hard, stony ground that renders animals lame, 
and yet never complain of fatigue. In our subsequent wanderings, we 
often remembered our Ladaki caravan men and their devoted service. 




FROM LEH TO KHOTAN 
THE GREAT KARAKORUM ROUTE

FROM LEH TO KHOTAN 
THE GREAT KARAKORUM ROUTE 

S EPTEMBER 19, 1925 — a memorable day in the annals of the 
expedition! A fine autumn morning with a light breeze from 
I the mountains, wonderfully cool and refreshing. A large crowd 
' of local inhabitants gathered to see us start. The crossing of the 
Khardong Pass, the first mountain pass on the Turkestan route, is usu- 
ally effected on yaks, which have to be hired from local peasants. The 
summit of the pass is covered by a glacier and the pack horses have usu- 
ally a bad time on it. When pack yaks are employed, the pack horses 
and mules of the caravans are driven empty across the pass. This is the 
usual custom of the country, no doubt prompted by many years of ex- 
perience. We decided to follow it and had ordered yaks several days in 
advance. For some reason or other, only half of the required forty yaks 
appeared in the early morning at the dak bungalow. We were obliged 
to wait the whole of the morning and a considerable portion of the 
afternoon, before all the woolly beasts reached the bungalow’s com- 
pound. As is customary, there was much hustle and shouting, the local 
Ladak headman using his cane rather freely. 

At last, about fovir o’clock in the afternoon, the long caravan column 
left the dak bungalow and filled the narrow road, which passes at the 
foot of the Leh Palace and leads to the small village of dGon-pa, and 
farther into the mountains. A large crowd followed us on foot, wishing 
us a successful journey. We rode past the barley fields and the Zangskar 
Convent, whose white walls are an outstanding feature on the plain 
north of Leh. 

After we had passed the last Ladaki village and barley fields, a group 
of Ladaki women and girls approached our column. They held in their 
hands brimming cups of yak milk. We all had to bow low in our 
saddles, and our foreheads and those of our animals were sprinkled 
with milk. In doing so they wished us godspeed and a safe journey 
amid the dangers of the forbidding Karakorum. 

’ For three hours we climbed the mountain. With each step, the coun-

try became more and more barren. The verdant gardens and fields of 
Ladak lay behind; and ahead of us towered the rugged mountains, 
their crests covered with glaciers and snow. Large bowlders hung over 
the mountain slopes, and we crossed vast masses of debris carried down 
the towering heights. Our caravan of pack horses under Nazar Bai and 
Omar Khan went ahead, with orders to wait for us at the northern side 
of the Khardong La in the small hamlet of Khalsar. 

We camped for the night on a stonypromontory, close to a ruined stone 
hut. A piercing northwest wind started soon after we had dismounted 
and we were obliged to seek shelter among the neighboring cliffs. Our 
men, perched under the rocks in their gray sheepskins, looked like 
gigantic vultures, gazing over the upland for some prey. The yak cara- 
van reached the spot only about ten o’clock at night. Its approach was 
heralded by the loud shouting and whistling of the drivers. Soon there 
appeared a dark moving mass, that slowly filled the open space on the 
small plateau of our camp. In complete darkness we began imloading 
and our inexperienced camp men had some difficulties in putting up 
the tents. The night was bitterly cold and the wind blew continuously, 
abating only toward dawn. 

The fine morning of September 20 was a distinct contrast to the 
previous dismal evening. The caravan was soon on the march, and the 
long black file of animals climbed the mountain path. We all rode yaks 
and our cavalry saddles looked strange on the shaggy black animals. 
The yaks arc wonderful climbers, and many travelers have spoken 
highly of these beasts of the mountains. The ascent of the Khardong 
La is comparatively easy, but a little too steep for horses. It took us fully 
three hours to reach the snow-capped summit of the pass. On many a 
turn we noticed frozen drops of blood — signs of passing caravans. Men 
and animals often bleed heavily at these altitudes. From the summit of 
the pass, the mountains seemed like a great sea, crowned with spar- 
kling white foam. 

The descent was steep and slippery. A glacier lay along the northern 
slope. We all had to dismount and walk down the pass. One of our 
pack yaks preferred to glide down the glacier and with amazing agility 
dashed down its steep slope. We all were sure that it would crash with 
its load against the huge bowlders that filled the narrow ravine below. 
But the animal suddenly turned at the critical point and sclf-con- 
tentedly joined its comrades on the trail. We had to walk a considerable 
distance down the pass. Far in the distance, a tiny green strip of vegeta- *

tion indicated the Shayok Valley, where lay the village of Khalsar, the 
meeting place of our caravan. We did not mount our horses, but con- 
tinued our journey on yaks. After two hours’ ride, we entered the 
Shayok Valley with its verdant bottom and sharply outlined rocks. For 
the last five miles, the road was flat and easy. About five o’clock in the 
afternoon, we were within view of the village of Khalsar, and soon no- 
ticed our czrzvaxi-bashis, Nazar Bai and Omar Khan, waiting for us 
outside the village. Two hours later we were encamped in the small but 
shady garden of the serai and were checking up our loads, as they ar- 
rived on yaks. From then on, for twenty-two days, the horses had to 
carry the loads and climb the forbidding heights of the mountain 
passes. 

Next day, September 21, we continued our march along the Shayok 
Valley. The country was gorgeous in its coloring — flaming yellow and 
red sandstone rocks and granites rose above the bright green spots of 
the valley bottom. 

Three miles above Khalsar, we crossed a suspension bridge, and rode 
as far as the picturesque village of Tirit. Here our headman L 6 n-po 
possessed an estate and a large arid comfortable country house. He was 
very anxious to accord us hospitality and made us stay for the night. 
The upper rooms of the house were clean and bright. The walls were 
gaily decorated with paintings, representing the eight happy signs of 
Tibetan religious ornamentation. The view from the roof of the house 
was superb and late into the night we enjoyed the magnificent moon- 
light which illumined the whole of the surrounding mountain country 
and the peaceful valley of the Shayok. The caravan men, unmindful of 
the hardships and privations ahead, sang around their camp fires, and 
the evening psalms of our Buddhist followers intermingled with the 
drawling melancholy songs of Turkestan. 

We were anxious to reach Panamik, the last settlement on the Kara- 
korum route, and rose early on September 22, before dawn had aroused 
the mountains, still hidden by a night-veil. 

Soon after Tirit the road turned into the valley of Nubra and led past 
numerous farmsteads, hamlets, and monasteries. It was lively with the 
sound of caravan bells; strings of horses and donkeys wearily moved 
toward Ladak. They were accompanied by dusty drivers, with their 
faces blackened by the winds and gales of the uplands. Days of hard 
traveling were behind them and they were hurrying to Leh to enjoy a 
"Inuch-needed rest.

On our way we visited the interesting monastery of Sandoling, which 
is only seldom mentioned in books on Ladak. The trail crossed the dry 
bed of a torrent, strewn with bowlders that once were swept from the 
mountain side. The assembly hall of the monastery contained a large 
image of Maitreya and fine large painted banners representing the 
same bodhisattva. The convent possesses the finest collection of reli- 
gious banners which we had seen in Ladak. The head lama of the 
monastery was absent and the young novices were slow and lazy in the 
discharge of their religious duties. 

We reached Panamik in the evening and pitched our camp in a 
grove of trees on the banks of a small brook, which suddenly rose and 
flooded the banks, endangering our camp. 

In Panamik we learned that two sahibs were stopping in the village. 
Shortly after, they came to see us, and proved to be two missionaries 
from the Swedish Mission in Kashgar. One of them. Rev. Mr. German- 
son, told us of the difficulties on the road. The conditions in Kashgar 
were not altogether peaceful and the city was still agitated after the 
coup d’Hat of Captain Ma and the assassination of the all-powerful 
G.O.C. of Kashgar, the dreaded Ma Fu-hsin. 

In the neighborhood of Panamik there were several chapels and a 
small Red sect monastery. Rock-cut images were said to exist higher 
up the valley, but we lacked the time to make a side excursion. 

The next stage, on September 23, brought us to the foot of the 
Karaul-davan, a small pass with avalanche-swept stone slopes. The 
day’s route followed along the left bank of the Nubra River and we 
could see distant villages on the right bank of the stream. An interest- 
ing corner of Ladak is this Nubra Valley. 

We camped on the edge of a plateau strewn with bowlders and much 
detritus. A Ladak caravan with yaks, bound for Kokyar and Yarkend, 
was camping beside us. Yak caravans are well suited for the mountain 
route of Karakorum, and their only drawback is the shortness of their 
daily stages. 

Long before dawn we heard the loud cries of ‘"Long, long, longl ” — 
“Arise, arise, arise!” — in the Ladaki camp, and camp fires soon flashed 
in the dark, showing shaggy figures drinking their morning tea and 
tsam-pa (parched barley flour). In the twilight, the dark mass of the 
yak caravan left the camp site and started for the pass. We followed it 
on our horses. The trail up the pass presented no difficulties, but the 
precipitous stone slopes and the numerous skeletons of men who had

fallen on the sharp rocks below spoke of the dangers of the pass. Our 
caravan had also to pay its toll. The line Badakhshani stallion belong- 
ing to Omar Khan, frightened by something, jumped suddenly and in- 
stantly crashed down the stone slope. It landed on the rocks beneath, 
still alive. A bullet from one of our rifles put an end to its agony. 

The descent from the pass is short and gradual, but the further route 
along the valley of a small rivulet is a dreadful accumulation of bowl- 
ders and detritus. It is almost incomprehensible how caravans can cross 
this stretch of the road! Bowlders, sharp stones, and treacherous holes, 
without foothold — such is the road after the Karaul-davan. For three 
hours we struggled through this stony mass, dismounting to help our 
horses over the dangerous places. The swift cold rivulet had to be 
crossed several times. It was hard to induce horses to enter the icy 
water. One of our sheep, driven along with the caravan, was carried 
away by the current, and could not be rescued. Utterly exhausted, we 
camped on a level patch of land. It was our intention to reach the foot 
of the Sasser Pass the same day, but Omar Khan reported that his pack 
horses were at the end of their strength and could hardly move farther. 

The camp was a very dismal one. In addition to the wind, wet snow 
drifted in the air; and the dark slopes of the mountains, rising on all 
sides of the small valley where we camped, made a dreary impression 
on us all. Our Chinese interpreter smoked his pipe, repeating wistfully: 
“Aya, Aya, such a road, such a road! Nowhere in Tibet did I see such 
roads.” In the evening two of our pack horses ate some poisonous grass 
and succumbed during the night. Their loads had to be distributed on 
the remaining animals. We warned the caravan men to be more careful 
and to tie the animals up wherever there was danger of poisonous grass. 

September 25, 1925. We made a short march up the valley at the foot 
of the Sasser Pass (17,500 feet) whose snowy mass towered northwest 
of our camp. Soon after our arrival, it began to snow and a sharp pierc- 
ing wind roared on the heights of the mountains, rapidly sweeping 
down the narrow valley. After a few seconds the entire landscape was 
enveloped in a whirl of snow and we all were sitting buried in it, our 
backs turned to the raging wind. The snow had to be shoveled away 
and the tents pitched in all haste, a task by no means easy at an altitude 
of some 15400 feet. 

The night was without wind and exceptionally quiet. Our horses 
roamed about the camp seeking some signs of weathered grass that 
iJhowed here and there from beneath the snow. In the morning we
