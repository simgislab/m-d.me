## PREFACE

UNDER the direction of the famous Russian artist, Nicholas Roerich, a remarkable expedition was conducted for five years through the various countries of central Asia. It penetrated regions where no westerner had been seen for many years; it brought back to the scientific world new knowledge of the history of that region of the “Roof of the World” which is of deep interest geographically and sociologically.

George N. Roerich, orientalist, accompanied his father. Previous to receiving his degree from Harvard, he was brought up in European traditions of culture, studying in the schools of Russia and England, and in France at the School of Oriental Languages, Paris, and at the College de France. Of an exceptionally synthetic tendency of mind, the young scholar has studied Persian and Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese. This extensive knowledge of languages provides him with the key to the mysteries of the “closed land.”

In the country of Tsaidam, George Roerich studied the different dialects of the local Mongol tribes and made the first complete dictionary of them.

From Tibet, George Roerich brings back a scientific picture of the life and civilizations of the nomads of the High Plateau. During his researches he discovered the existence of an artistic style peculiar to the nomads — primarily animalistic — a style closely related to that of the ancient Scythians and Goths. Thus he presents strong arguments in justification of the theory, concerning the ancient civilization of the nomads, whose territory extended from the Gobi Desert and the border of Korea to the lower Danube and the Carpathian Mountains.

x

A most interesting discovery rewarded the efforts of the explorers. On the uplands of Tibet and in the country of the Trans-Himalayas, the expedition carefully studied and photographed many monuments (cromlechs, alinements, menhirs) whose existence had never before been recorded and whose structure evokes most interesting comparisons with our western monuments, especially those of Brittany.

Because of his knowledge of the languages and customs of the countries, George Roerich visited Buddhist monasteries, usually completely forbidden to strangers; he discovered a complete collection of the sacred books of die Bön-po religion, three hundred volumes, which constitute an inesdmable treasure for the history of religions and oriental research.

During these five years. Professor Nicholas Roerich painted nearly five hundred pictures; the collection presents a unique panorama of the least-known regions of the great Asiatic continent.

Through their efforts and their sacrifices, their fortitude in the face of dangers which threatened their lives again and again, and their bravery under attack, the members of the expedition have gready served science, art, and all nations advancing the progress of humanity.

The book which George Roerich dedicated to the scientific results of the expedition marks an important date in the history of Orientalism and represents a contribution of the first order to the conquests of civilization.

## AUTHOR’S NOTE

INNER Asia with its towering mountain ranges and limitless deserts and steppes, a country of great climatic extremes, and the cradle of hardy nomad tribes that once shook the frontiers of China and of the Near Eastern countries, has always been an endless lure to the explorer. In the past a brilliant line of men inaugurated the fight for geographical discoveries in the forbidden lands of Asia. The story of their achievement is one of the most fascinating pages in the history of such explorations. Besides securing valuable scientific information and opening new regions for the progress of humanity, they upheld that spirit of adventure to which our civilization owes its spread. Their example made it possible for others to continue the hazardous task of conquest of distant and unknown lands.

In inner Asia we are able to survey one of the grandest mountain systems of the world; to journey for months across waterless deserts of sand dnd stone and upland plains; and to study the vestiges of a past culture that once linked ancient China with the coiuitries of the Mediterranean basin.

The vast, undrained area of inner Asia is buttressed on the south by the mighty Trans-Himalayas, and the bleak highlands of the successive ranges of the Karakorum. Its northern frontier is formed by the Altai and the mountain chains along the southern rim of the Siberian lowlands. To the east and west this great inner basin is open , toward vast expanses of desert and steppe that comprise the Great Mongolian Gobi and the steppe lands of Russian Turkestan.

This inner region of Asia the Roerich Central Asian Expedition, under the leadership of Professor Nicholas Roerich, traveled and explored for almost five successive years. The chief object of the expedition was to create a pictorial record of lands and peoples of inner Asia; the five hundred paintings by Professor Roerich, brought back by the expedition and now on permanent exhibition in the Roerich Museum at New York, constitute a unique achievement of this purpose.

The second object of the expedition was to survey the possibilities for new archaeological explorations and thus to prepare the way for future enterprises in die same region.

The third object was to secure an extensive collection of ethnographi-

xii

cal and linguistic material, illustrating the culture of these regions. During its long journey along the Tien Shan, the steppe region of Jungaria, the Altai, the mountains of southwestern Mongolia, and the highlands of Tibet, the expedition surveyed numerous archaeological sites; and it is hoped that another expedition may be mustered to carry out extensive excavations of vast necropoli left by nomad tribes, which date back to the period between the &st and eighth centuries a.d. A large collection of Tibetan and Mongolian books was gathered during the expedition’s stay in Mongolia and Tibet.

In sending out this expedition into the field, the Trustees of the Roerich Museum felt the growing necessity of an active American participation in a work which for several decades had attracted the attention of prominent scientists in Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia.

The expedition left New York in May, 1923, and in December of the same year reached Darjeeling in British Sikkim. Here a base was established and several trips were conducted into Sikkim. The whole of 1924 was spent in Sikkim in preparation for the more extensive journey into inner Asia. It was imperative to acquire a good speaking knowledge of the Tibetan language before starting on a journey which would require constant relations with natives. The narrative in the present volume begins with the moment of the expedition’s departure from Darjeeling.

During his five years of active field service with the expedition, the author profited on many occasions by the help and advice of friends and it is a pleasant task to convey his appreciative thanks for the services they so willingly rendered:

To the President and Board of Trustees of the Roerich Museum, for their devoted care and friendly assistance during the expedition’s perilous journey.

To Col. F. M. Bailey, C.I.E., British Political Officer in Tibet, Sikkim, and Bhutan, for his valuable help during the expedition’s stay in Sikkim and on its return from Tibet in 1928.

To Major Gillan, British Consul General at Kashgar, for his active assistance dxiring a most trying period in Khotan.

To His Excellency M. Louis Marin, for his ever helpful assistance and for contributing an introduction to this present volume.

To my teacher. Professor Jacques Bacot, who first introduced me into the ancient lore of Tibet

xiii

To my friend, Dr. Georges G. Chklaver, of the University of Paris, for his untiring interest in my exploration work and his trusted friendship.

To Dr. Johan van Manen, learned Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, who placed at my disposal the resoiurces of the library of the Society at Calcutta.

To Lama Lobzang Mingyur Dorje, my teacher and friend, for his untiring help in my Tibetan studies.

To Malcolm W. Davis, editor of the Yale University Press, in appreciation of his interest in this publication.

Last, but not least, I wish to record my admiration and gratitude to all the European and native members of the Roerich Central Asian Expedition, who unfailingly carried out their duties under most trying conditions.

I dedicate this volume to my Mother and Father, who guided me on the path of exploration and since my boyhood inspired me in the quest for new discoveries and new knowledge.

## KASHMIR-LADAK

### I

KASHMIR-LADAK

ON the sixth of March, 1925, the expedition left the hill station of Darjeeling, and with it the friendly country of Sikkim. It is always a wonderful experience to travel down the jungle-clad slopes of the eastern Himalayas. The tropical vegetation and the endless stream of hill people who wander along the cart road are full of interest to the traveler. In complete darkness, we reached Siliguri. The train was rolling over the low-lying plain of Bengal— jungle-clad and fever-infected marshy tracts, and rice fields already flowed. Through the blackness of the tropical night, one could see the strange life proceeding around the glittering lights of numerous fires scattered in the jungle and in front of small village huts, that stood here and there among palm trees. Figures in white turbans and dhoti moved about, and at the railway stations the air resounded with the high-pitched cries of peddlers selling tea, drinking water, and cigarettes. The country seemed alive with intense movement screened by the dusky veil of the night.

Early in the morning the train rolled into the large station of Sealdah. A traveler who comes from the mountain solitudes of the Himalayas is invariably struck by the semi-European, semi-oriental character of the city. The Calcutta streets, with modern motor cars, horse carriages, rickshaws, cows, and a multicolored crowd of pedestrians, seem indeed to be a stream in which East and West mingle in a striking manner. After a busy and hot day in the great city, including a visit to the headquarters of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, that distinguished institution which is a monument of noble cooperation between western and eastern scholars, we again entrained on the Punjab Mail for the long two days' and two nights' journey across the dusty plains of northern India.

The hot season was already approaching and a peculiar and intense glare hung over the horizon.

On the evening of the eighth of March we reached RawalpindL Several hours before the cantonment, the train traversed an arid country of sand and stone, cut into numerous canyons. After i night spent at a lo-

4 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

cal hotel at Rawalpindi we again resumed our route, but this time in motor cars. Rawalpindi has the atmosphere of alertness of a great military station. Everywhere there are khaki-clad figures; and the town bazaars throng with the colorful crowd of a border country. Fine-looking Hazaras and martial Pathans from the frontier move among the groups of Punjabis and down-country men.

The motor road to Srinagar through Murree has been so often described that I need not dwell too long on this portion of our journey. It is one of the finest motor roads in the world, and the scenery is at times magnificent. Rising gradually, at Murree the road reaches the altitude of some seven thousand feet above sea level.

We spent the night in the resthouse at Garhi, a small village on Kashmir territory at an altitude of 2,628 feet. In the evening we admired the Mohammedan festival of Bakr-Id, when the whole countryside was acclaiming the advent of the spring. Flaming circles of men brandishing torches were moving about the hillside on the opposite river bank, and above them towered the somber silhouettes of the mountains. An unforgettable picture of Indian spring!

Next morning brought us to Uri, a picturesque village and fort situated at an altitude of 4,370 feet. The mountain landscape near Uri was of outstanding beauty; patches of snow intensified the deep blue coloring of the surrounding mountains. After Uri, we passed the ruined temple of Brankutri, similar to the other temples of Kashmir dating back to the Indian Middle Ages. About noon we drove through the small town of Baramulla. The day was beautifully clear and we obtained a fine view of the Nanga Parbat, towering to a height of 26,900 feet.

For the few miles outside of the city of Srinagar, there runs one of the most beautiful drives in the world, bordered with rows of high poplars. All around lies the famous Kashmir Valley, engirded by lofty snowy mountains.

About three o’clock in the afternoon we drove into the native city of Srinagar, and were at once assailed by a motley crowd of Kashmiris, yelling and crying, abusing each other, offering goods: Kashmiri products, houseboats, shikaras, and other attractions of Kashmir. It was a sad sight.

We establidied our headquarters at the Nedou Hotel and at once began our preparation for the journey to Ladak and the desert lands of Chinese Turkestan, lying beyond the lofty passes of the Karakmrum

5 KASHMIR-LADAK

and Sanju. A difficult and long mountain journey necessitates protracted preparations and every detail must be thoroughly checked personally; a journey such as that from Kashmir to Chinese Turkestan over die highest moimtain route in the world, requires unusual forethought and careful consideration. Srinagar is the last place where such preparations can be made and food supplies obtained. The Kashmiri artisans are famed for their work and, if supervised, turn out serviceable equipment. There are a number of native firms in the city which produce excellent winter outfits and camping furniture. Naturally, the traveler must keep a watchful eye on the execution of his order. All the expedition supplies had to be packed in yaghtans or wooden boxes covered with leather. Tin or iron boxes are of no use in mountain travel, for they easily break.

The winter outfit for the cold weather on the mountain passes and the winter in Chinese Turkestan consisted of fur coats lined with *pashmina*, Gilgit fur boots, fur caps, fur socks, and fur sleeping bags. We also ordered several tents of waterproof Willesden canvas with warm pattoo lining. These tents had to be specially constructed to withstand the rough traveling and the mountain gales. They consisted of two flies, the outer fly reaching the ground to prevent the strong wind of the higher uplands from penetrating beneath and lifting the tent. The tent poles were of thick bamboo with strong metal joints, and the tent pegs of galvanized iron.

We also decided to buy our own riding horses in order to be self-equipped and independent of local transport, which is not always reliable. Srinagar is a good horse market, and one can usually get good animals of the Yarkendi or Badakhshani breed. These breeds are famous throughout central Asia and are invaluable on long travels. The Zangskar ponies are good for mountains, but as a rule of uncertain temper and hard-mouthed.

With the kind help of Mr. Nedou, the proprietor of the local hotel, we soon succeeded in buying six fine horses which carried us from Kashmir to the confines of the Altai.

The departure was fixed for the beginning of August, and, meanwhile, we decided to use our free time for a little touring in the Kashmir Valley.

I shall not describe the capital or the valley of Kashmir. Concerning them there is a voluminous literature, and the antiquities of the country

6 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

have been studied and commented upon by such men as Sir Aurel Stein.

Comparing the beauties of nature, and the unique gardens of Nishad and Shalimar laid out by the Great Moguls Akbar and Jehangir with the sad realities of the native city of Srinagar, one is always struck by the deep contrast. We were glad to leave the “Indian Venice” and to feel ourselves again in the open country of the beautiful valley. We hired a large house boat, *The Monarch*, belonging to a sympathetic Kashmiri, Sobra Wanganu, and started for a short trip to Vulur Lake.

The trip along the channels offers little of interest. The boat slowly moves past low-lying banks. The water channels are narrow and the water not always clear. The big lake of Vulur lies engirded by high mountain ranges and in fine weather wonderful shadows play on the mountain sides. We landed at Bandipur, a small village with some commissariat barracks, lying at the head of the Gilgit Road that leads across Gilgit, Hunza, and Sarikol to Kashgar and the Tarim basin. We experienced a violent windstorm on the lake, which broke all the ropes by which the boat was secured to the shore and almost carried it away into the open. The boatmen spent several anxious hours fighting the storm. The house boats are not seagoing and never venture into the open in windy weather. The dunga boat, in which our Chinese interpreter and servants wae staying, had its roof carried away by the wind. Since boatmen considered our position very unsafe, we had to curtail our visit on the lake.

The next day proved to be fine and we had enough time to recross the lake into the channel. The afternoon was stormy again, but we were not affected by it.

About the fifteenth of April, we moved to Gulmarg, the hill station of Kashmir. Here, in the coolness of the mountains, we could conclude our preparations and study the different problems presented by our coming journey. We arrived early in the season and the hill station was still covered by snow. For a whole week we experienced tremendous thunderstorms. The thunder rolled and crashed in the mountains and the ligh tnin g swept round our house in a large circle, illumining the whole neighborho^ at night. For several days we were completely cut off from the outside world and had to keep to our rooms. Nowhere else did we experience electrical storms of such terrific violence. They were usually followed by hail, and some of the hailstones were of surprising size.

7 KASHMIR-LADAK

At Gulmarg we spent the whole of May, June, and July. By the end of July we had received all our outfit and, on the eighth of August, the expedition left Gulmarg for Ganderbal on its long journey to Ladak and Chinese Turkestan.

Ganderbal is conveniently reached by motor cars. It is the starting point of the Ladak Treaty Route. Our caravans consisted of eighty-two pack ponies which were to carry our loads up to Dras on the Ladak side 0^ the Zoji Pass - an alarming number considering the difficulties of obtaining sufficient forage.

We reached Ganderbal late in the evening of the same day, and found our caravan men already camping in the courtyard of the resthouse. Great camp fires illumined the faces of the men and the long rows of caravan animals.

Next morning, August 9, we rose early but were somewhat delayed by the unloading of the supplies from the boats which had carried them from Srinagar. The men were new to caravan work and had to be directed in every detail. Our headman, Wahaba Wanganu, was a cold-blooded and remarkably efficient man who kept the rest of the expedition servants well in hand.

Late in the afternoon the whole caravan moved out of Ganderbal. We drove by motor as far as the little village of Nunner, then moxmted our horses and crossed the Sindh near Wayil. The route follows the right bank of the river for about two miles, and it was a pleasant ride past flowering meadows.

Kangan is a small village with a large bungalow, where we found several other travelers. The route from Kangan to Baltal at the foot of Zoji Pass has been often described, and I shall limit myself to a few comments.

The Leh Treaty Route was made passable for peaceful caravans by the efforts of Colonel Durand’s column in 1891. The Kashmir State takes a great interest in this route, and the transport and supplies are carefully organized. State granaries and spacious serais or resthouses for trading caravans are maintained at various stages along the route.

The route passes Gund and Sonamarg, the summer camping ground of many European visitors. Fine weather accompanied us up to Sonamarg. At Gimd we had a sad experience with our horses which only by a lucky chance did not prove fatal to them. All along the route from Ganderbal to Baltal is a kind of poisonous grass, locally called *gumai*. The horses of the region never touch it, but strange horses often eat it

8 TRAILS TO IMOST ASIA

and perish. Through die negligence of our syces, four of our best horses ate some of this grass and fell ill in the evening. We tried our best to hdp them, but their condition rapidly grew worse. All local remedies were without avail. Finally, we decided to give them a good dose of bicarbonate of soda. This worked wonders. By the next morning all four of the animals were all right and were able to proceed to Sonamarg.

On the road we met the first party of Ladakis on their way to Srinagar. They were dressed in the usual gray homespun — the universal clothing of Tibetan laity. Soon after our arrival at Sonamarg, which is situated at an altitude of some 8,600 feet, it began to rain heavily and continued to do so for the whole night. We had to stay at the dak bungalow for the entire morning, starting only about two o’clock in the afternoon, after the rain had subsided somewhat. Sonamarg, said to be the loveliest spot in Kashmir, did not strike us as a place of exceptional natural beauty. We saw some fine meadows surrounded on all sides with pine forests, but the neighboring moimtains were hidden behind an impenetrable veil of mist and clouds that hovered over the peaks.

The trail was slippery and our pack animals had a hard time on it. After three hours’ march, we reached Baltal, situated amid a birch and pine forest. The bungalow was occupied by visitors from Srinagar, and we preferred to pitch our own camp on a fine meadow outside the resthouse.

The rain started again toward evening and continued for the rest of the night. In the early morning a party of Balti pony men arrived from the pass and reported a landslide there. This bad news m^ant that we would have to stay for the day at Baltal and send up men to clear the road of the dibris. We sent our chief shi\an, Satar Khan, and ten of our pony men out to the pass with spades to repair the trail. Toward noon the rain started again with renewed force and the dismal weather continued until late into the evening. Everything was wet and we had to take the greatest precautions to keep our boxes with food supplies dry. Our men returned toward evening, and reported that the road was elear but that several other places were threatened by avalanches if the rain continued. Luckily for us it stopped toward evening, and by five o’clock in the morning the sky was beautifully clear.

The route from Ganderbal to Baltal runs though a typical Kashmir mountain country with well-watered hillsides, receiving plenty of mois-

ture and covered with luxuriant meadows and pine forests. The great change comes only after the Zoji Pass. We started about six o’clock in the morning and slowly ascended the pass. It presents no difBculty in late summer or autumn. But in winter it is dangerous, and practicable only for men, for its avalanche-swept slopes are covered with ice and snow which may at any time give way and carry the traveler down the precipice. Traffic is closed for the whole of winter and during early spring, dming which time the traveler has to pay special rates to the coolies who agree to iace the peril on the s ummi t of die pass.

The Zoji La route was already known in ancient times. The first mention of the route is made by the Chinese pilgrim Wu-k’ung who visited Kashmir between 751-790 A.D. and mentions the route to Tibet across the Zoji Pass.(1) It has witnessed numerous conflicts in the past. In the fourteenth century came the Turks and shordy after them, the Ladaki Prince Rin-chen, who swept into the Kashmir Valley.(2) In 1532 A.D. the f^ous Mirza Mohammad Haidar entered the valley of Kashmir and successfully fought near the pass. (3)

The Zoji Pass (11,300 feet) possesses another name of Du-shi-la (dus-bshi-la). According to the Rev. Dr. A. H. Francke ,4 the name is a contracted form of the name of the goddess Du-shi lha-mo, the wife of the *siddha* Naropa. According to the popular story related by Dr. Francke, Naropa had to leave her behind because of her Kashmiri smell. The goddess, in disgust, turned her back upon Ladak, and this caused Ladak to dry up and Kashmir to become a verdant valley.

On ascending the pass, the Iwdscape changed completely. We now entered the typical Tibetan mountain country. Barren mountain ridges rose on both sides and between them lay a broad upland plain covered by stone bowlders and scant grazing lands.

At Mitsahoi, on the ninth mile, we stopped for an hour and then resumed our march toward the broad plain on which lies the resthouse of Matayan. The day had become overcast and heavy gray clouds hung over the mountain peaks. The last six miles to Matayan we rode in a pouring rain that made the path slippery, and we were glad to reach die resthouse and camp for the night.

Next day we continued our march to Dras. Passing through the

10 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

small hamlet of Prandes we saw several hirmsteads, surrounded by barley fields, which looked like small strongholds. After an hour’s ride from Prandes, we entered the open valley of Dras.

Dras, properly speaking, is a series of small hamlets scattered over the broad valley watered by the Dras River. The population consists of Dards and Balds.

Near to the bungalow stands the modern Dogra Fort. Ruins of several old strongholds are scattered over the valley and the foot of the hills. The Tibetan name for Dras is Hembabs. The altitude is about 10,000 feet.

For me the chief interest in Dras lay in the Buddhist stone sculptures, found on the roadside outside the villages of Dras. They are four in all and have been described by Sir Alexander Cunningham, who took them to represent female deities, and by Dr. Francke, who correcdy described them in his *Antiquities of Indian Tibet* (5) The first small stone represents a figure of a horseman, probably the portrait of a local raja who erected the two bodhisattva images as recorded in the Sharada inscripdon on the reverse of the stone. The stone next to the first one represents the Bodhisattva Maitreya. The Bodhisattva is represented standing and attired in the princely costume of a rajakumara or royal prince. In his raised right hand he holds a rosary and his left hand supports a vase or bum-pa. On his head he wears the diadem (*mukuta*). Below the principal figure one sees figures of devotees. On the right corner of the stone there is a Sharada inscription, which is unfortunately very much damaged.

I have already noticed elsewhere (6) that the cult of Maitreya was associated with the spread of Mahayana.

The presence of images of the Bodhisattva Maitreya along the caravan route Kashmir-Ladak, and along other caravan routes of central Asia, seems to be significant.

The third stone represents the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara with two attendants. On the stone above the head of one of the attendants, Dr. Francke has discovered a much-damaged inscription.

The fourth stone represents a lotus flower. Dr. Francke dates the images approximately from the tenth century A.D. They have undoubtedly some connection with the spread of Buddhism into the kingdoms of westernmost Tibet and, as such, may belong to the ninth century A.D.

At Dras we had to change our transport. This necessitated long nego-

11 KASHMIR-LADAK

tiations with the local headmen, who had to supply pack animals. Thanks to the excellent organization of the relay service on the route, travelers usually find their transport ready for them. In our case we required at least seventy pack animals — a large number for the scant population along the route. By the evening everything was settled, and pack horses and dzo (a crossbreed between a yak and a cow) began to pour into the dak bungalow’s compound. In the morning we went through the usual “ceremony” of the distribution of our loads by the headmen among the pony drivers. Dark-turbaned men swarmed in the courtyard and the loading was accompanied by the usual loud cries and occasional wrangles. I must credit the Ladakis and Baltis with remarkably quick loading.

Leaving Dras, the trail skirts barley fields fenced by low stone walls, and descends toward the Dras River.

The small hamlet of Dundelthang was the scene of a recent tragedy. An American traveler, Mr. Landon, disappeared here, while on his way to Ladak. His body was subsequently found and buried in the small European cemetery at Leh.

The valley narrows and the path follows the left bank of the river that flows through a fine gorge. We reached Shimsha Kharbu late in the afternoon and camped for the night in the resthouse, pleasantly situated in a garden of willows. Above the bungalow stand the ruins of a castle said to have belonged to Khri Sultan of Sod, a place near Kargil. In Shimsha Kharbu, Ladakis are already more prominent.

In the serai close to the bungalow we found a small caravan of Yarkend traders and some pilgrims from Kashgar on their way to distant Mecca. Since the Great War most of these pilgrims travel across the high passes of the Karakorum, and then through Bombay and by sea. Many die on these journeys, but a great many return to occupy an honored place in their communities.

The next march brought us to the thriving little town of Kargil, the last big settlement in the Dard district. At Kharal there is a good suspension bridge. From here a road branches off to Skardo, and crosses the river, whereas the trail to Kargil follows up the bank of the Sum River.

In Dong-ga, which is situated between Shimsha Kharbu and Chanigund, there is a bowlder with many carvings, representing ibex, afchers, and swastika figures. These stone carvings are widespread over Ladak and the neighboring mountain countries and are found as far as

12 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

the Sanju Oasis on the northern side of the Sanju Pass. They belong to the primitive nature religion of Tibet, usually designated by the name of Bön. (7) The ibex is very popular in the ancient fire cult of the Mongols, and is connected with the idea of fecundity. It seems that these stone carvings belonging to a remote common religious period of inner Asia.

Kargil is situated on a vast plateau. The alluvial slopes that gradually descend toward the river are under irrigation. The town is the capital of the Purig Province, whose population consists of Tibetan stock which has embraced Islam. The streets of the village are thronged with a motley crowd of traders and other visitors to the town market. Sturdy and fair-looking Yarkendis mingle with men from Gilgit and Hunza. Short and squarely built Ladakis, in gray homespun, urge droves of horses and donkeys along the streets. Hawk-nosed Kashmiris, with red flaming beards, bargain with black-turbaned Dards and men from Skardo.

We experienced some trouble in raising the required number of pack animals. A big trading caravan had requisitioned all that were available, and we spent several busy hours in making arrangements. Finally a small caravan of Ladakis was persuaded to hire out their animals for the next stage.

A place of interest in the town is the Dogra Castle, constructed in modern times; another is the Sod Castle, a little north of Kargil, which we had no time to visit.

The next march brought us from Dardistan to Buddhist Ladak. On leaving the town of Kargil, the road crosses a vast sandy plateau. After two hours’ ride, we reached the large village of Pashkyum, the scene of a victorious raid by the Dogras. Beyond the village, the trail enters a narrow gorge of sandstone rocks. The first Buddhists are met at Shar-go-lha (Shar-’go-lha). At this village the valley suddenly widens and a string of *chortens* or *stupas* (shrines) heralds the entrance into the Buddhist kingdom of Ladak.

The village of Shar-go-lha is prominent in local history. According to tradition, one of the ministers of the Tibetan King Srong-btsan-sgam-po, the bLön-po Rig-pa-can, is said to have been born there. His house is still shown situated near the bridge of Shar-go-lha.

Close to the village there is a cave monastery of considerable interest.

7\. The bowlder was reproduced in Francke's *Antiquities of Indian Tibet*, I, 44.

13 KASHMIR-LADAK

According to a local tradition, the monastery was built by two local diiefs, Thog-lde-jo and Yang-lde-jo. (8)

The last three miles of the road from Shar-go-lha to Mulbe passed through a country of unusual grandeur. In sharp, bold outlines lie the rugged and rocky mountain ridges. The small village of Mulbe clusters at the foot of a crag on which stands the small lamasery of Mulbe. We spent the night at the resthouse, situated at some distance from the village.

Mulbe and its antiquities have been already thoroughly studied and investigated by Dr. Francke, an admirable student of west Tibetan antiquities. His researches are embodied in a learned article, "The Rock Inscriptions at Mulbe." (9)

Mulbe boasts of an old Dard castle, two monasteries, and several important inscriptions found on the rock on which one of the monasteries is situated. The chief interest of Mulbe consists, however, in a colossal stone figure of Maitreya. The image was first noticed and described by Moorcroft in i820. (10) It represents the Bodhisattva standing, and is some twenty feet in height. The Bodhisattva is attired in the costume of an Indian ascetic, with the sacred brahmanical string which serves to distinguish bodhisattva images from feminine deities wearing a costume similar to that of a Bodhisattva. It is difficult to say anything definite about the date of the image. Its purely Indian character is evident, and as a work of art it occupies an outstanding place among the stone sculptures of Ladak. Local tradition attributes the image to the time of the great *lotsa-wa* or translator, Rin-chen-bzang-po (Ratnabhadra 964 - 1054 A.D.). I believe that this must not be far from the truth and that the stone image belongs to the tenth or eleventh centuries A.D. The lower half of the image is hidden by a small temple or *lha-khang* built by Wazir Söd-nam, the local landlord. An aged priest officiates in the chapel, and offers flower garlands and *ghee* to the image, before which an offering lamp burns on a low altar table. The walls of the chapel are decorated with frescoes representing the "eight great sons of Nyewa" who are said to have carved the image. The keeper belongs to an old family of astrologers and his duty is said to be hereditary in the family. (11)

From the outside, the image is hidden by trees and the chapel, but

14 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

when one enters the edifice, one suddenly sees the colossal statue rising before one’s eyes. It makes a lasting and powerful impression on everyone who visits the spot.

From the chapel we went to visit the house of the local landlord who had erected the chapel of Maitreya. It is situated a little above the road and is a typical Tibetan house, with stables and servants’ quarters on the ground floor and the living quarters on the upper floor. We found the widow of the landlord in her private chapel where she was offering daily prayers for the welfare of the soul of her departed husband. Wealthy Tibetan families very often spend considerable sums in memory of their departed members. Large donations are presented to monasteries, which must pray for the salvation and speedy reincarnation of the departed. The widow of the late landlord of Mulbe employed a lama who spent his days murmuring prayers and rhythmically striking his drum.

The chapel contained some clay and brass images of Sakyamuni, the Teacher Padmasambhava, and Tara, the Saviouress, besides several photographs representing the abbot or *sku-shok* of the Hemis Monastery, the Tashi Lama of Tsang, and the Dalai Lama of Lhasa.

The housemaids were busy grinding barley and pressing oil on the flat roof of the house.

From the landlord’s house we proceeded up the steep crag to the monastery situated on its summit. It is a tiny temple of the usual Tibetan architecture, situated inside a small compound. The *lha-khang* is in charge of an aged priest. Inside the temple stands an altar with a gilded clay image of Padmasambhava. A small library containing the sixteen volumes of the Prajnaparamita or 'Bum is placed along the walls of the temple. This monastery belongs to the Dug-pa sect of the unreformed Nying-ma-pa School of Tibetan Buddhism.

Returning from the monastery, we examined the inscriptions carved on the rock surface. Among them there is an edict promulgated by the King 'Bum-lde and a wedding congratulation to King Jamyang ('Jam-dbyangs) and his queen.

We made an early start next day in order to reach the next stage, Bod-Kharbu.

The road leads across the Namike Pass, at an altitude of 13,000 feet; the ascent is very gradual and after crossing the pass, the trail leads into the valley of Kharbu, interesting for its many ruined castles that crown the barren summits of mountain spins. The place was the scene of con-

15 KASHMIR-LADAK

siderable warfare in the reign of King Del-den (bDe-ldan rnam-rgyal, 1620-40 A.D.).

The valley bottom is watered by a small rivulet, the Tanjichu, and is covered by verdant barley fields carefully fenced with stone inclosures. We camped in the resthouse of Bod-Kharbu, a small Ladaki village situated at an elevation of some 11,000 feet. On the opposite side of the river stand, high on a steep rock, the important ruins of the castle of sTag-rtse. A little down the valley to the north lies the old castle of Chigtan. The village of Chigtan has also a small lamasery which might be assigned to the eleventh century A.D.

The old town of Kharbu, probably destroyed during the war waged by King Del-den rnam-rgyal against the Khri Sultan of Kartse (about 1620-30 A.D,) lies on the sandstone plateau above the village of Bod-Kharbu. (12) Above the ruined town stands the old castle of Kharbu, also in ruins.

Outside the village in a narrow gorge is situated a small Buddhist temple or lha-khang. We found in it an old lama, worshiping several clay images, the one in the middle of the altar representing Spyan-ras-gzigs Thugs-rje-chen-po, Avalokitesvara, the Merciful Lord. The temple possessed no library of its own, except for some prayer manuals.

The next stage brought us to Lamayuru, the famous monastery on the Kashmir-Ladak route. A view of unique grandeur opens before the traveler from the summit of the Pho-tho La Pass, 14,000 feet above sea level — a vast amphitheater of rugged mountains, sharp rocks, and distant snowy peaks.

An hour’s ride down the gradually descending slope, and the first stupas, standing at the entrance into the narrow gorge, emerge from behind a low sandy spur. On entering the narrow valley, an amazing scene presents itself. High up on steep sandstone rocks stands the picturesque lamasery of Lamayuru. Chorten and monastic cells cluster in the narrow folds of the cliffs. The steep sides of the cliffs are excavated with numerous caves used as storerooms and sometimes living quarters by the inhabitants of the village. Such cave villages are known to exist throughout Tibet and are especially noticeable in the western districts of the country. The present village of Lamayuru is situated at the foot of the cliffs and a little above the resthouse.

We spent an extra day at Lamayuru and visited the monastery. At present it belongs to the ’Bri-khung-pa sect of Lamaism. According to

12\. Francke, *A History of Western Tibet*, p. 98.

i6  TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

the local monastic tradition, it was founded by the famous mahasiddha Naropa who lived in the ninth century a.d. and with whose name are associated many events in the church history of Ladak. The name of the monastery is said to be a corruption of gYung-drung or Svastika, the synonym of Bon, i.e., the primitive nature religion of Tibet. Dr. Francke relates the following legend about the name of the monastery:

When Naropa . . . arrived at the site the whole valley was filled with a lake which he caused to dry up. The monastery received its name from a plantation of sacrificial grain which miraculously grew into the shape of the Svastika (*gYung-drung*). It is interesting that there are traces of deposits of a former lake all around the mountains of Lamayuru, and it is strange that Drew in his book does not make any mention of them. But the Ladakis must really have a geological instinct, to be able to invent stories of this kind. They have also tales of the existence of former lakes at Leh and at Triloka-nath in Lahul. The name gYung-drung was of course not given by Naropa, but must date back to a time long before he arrived in the country, as it was then the foremost place of the Bon religion which is called gYung-drung Bön. (13)

We visited the *du-khang* or assembly hall in which some twenty monks were reciting prayers — the library of the monastery containing a Kanjiir and Tdnjiir of the Narthang print — and the small courtyard in which the religious dances take place.

The Incarnate Lama of Lamayuru was away, and we were allowed to visit his living rooms, which were, as usual, neat and orderly.

According to the lamas of the monastery, the oldest part of the convent is the temple called Seng-ge sgang, situated at the southern end of the cliff of Lamayuru. The principal image is that of Manjushri or Jam-pe yang. According to a local tradition the Seng-ge sgang temple dates back to the bKa-gdams period, that is the eleventh century A.D. Dr. A. H. Francke, who visited this temple, thinks that the tradition is quite in agreement with the general appearance of the temple. (14)

We also paid a visit to a ruined Bön sanctuary, referred to by Dr. Francke. (15) Unfortxmately the frescoes that once adorned the walls of the edifice were in a very dilapidated condition and one could hardly identify the images represented on them.

On the twenty-third of August we broke camp and started on our further journey, hoping to reach the hamlet of Nuria in one day’s march.

17 KASHMIR-LADAK

The trail is rather bad. In several places one has to cross avalanche-swept slopes and sand and gravel continuously drift down into the stream. Several times we had to cross large accumulations of dSbris — traces of a recent avalanche. After three hours’ march we reached the open valley of the Indus and crossed the great river by a suspension bridge to the important village of Khalatse.

Khalatse, the old Dard center, is known for its antiquities, and Dr. A. H. Francke has recorded most of them*® in several of his articles and books. It was formerly a Dard colony, and there still exists here a ruined Dard castle. The Ladak king Lha-chen Nag-lug (1150-75 A.D.) built the important castle of Brag-nag, whose ruins still tower over the village. Dr. Francke has discovered a number of old Kharoshthi, Brahmi and Gupta inscriptions, which present many difficulties to the decipherer.

The modern village of Khalatse is pleasantly situated among apricot groves. After a brief halt at the village, we continued our march toward Nuria (sNyur-la). The trail leads over a stony level ground. The heat in midday was intense. We reached sNyur-la in the afternoon and took up quarters for the night in the small resthouse of the place.

The march from sNyur-la to Saspola leads across a barren country almost entirely devoid of vegetation. Saspola itself is a large village with numerous tree groves. Across the Indus, some two miles distant, lies the interesting monastery of Alchi, one of the oldest convents of Ladak. This monastery dates back to the time of Rin-chen bzang-po (eleventh century) and has preserved much of its old Indian wood-carvings which recall the finely executed carvings of medieval Kashmir. In the village of Saspola itself there exist two ruined stupas attributed to Rin-chen bzang-po. On the ruined foundation of the largest one has been erected a small monastery, named Cham-pa gom-pa (Byams-pa dgon-pa). It contains a large image of gilded clay of the Bodhisattva Maitreya and several other large images of standing bodhisattvas. According to local tradition, the standing statue of Maitreya was erected by Rin-chen bzang-po himself. Most probably the present statue dates from a comparatively recent time and possibly replaced an older one, which might have dated from the time of the great translator.

i8 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

The next march from Saspola to sNye-mo was interesting for several old monasteries. On leaving the village of Saspola, the trail crosses a vast sandy plateau. Not far from the route lies the important monastery of kLu-dkyil, popularly pronounced Likir. It was founded by King Lha-chen rgyal-po (ca. 1050-80 A.D.). The trail descends into the deeper valley and reaches the romantically situated hamlet of Basgo, famous for one of the oldest monasteries of Ladak and for the ancient palace of its kings.

An old temple, founded by King Thse-dbang rnam-rgyal, contains a huge statue of Maitreya, Avalokitesvara, and curious wall frescoes. The ancient palace of Ladak kings has a small monastery of Seljang. It contains a big statue of Bodhisattva Maitreya, said to have been erected by King Seng-ge rnam-rgyal about 1610 a.d. It also contains the ancient royal library of Ladak. So far as I know, its contents were never thoroughly investigated nor the volumes catalogued. Basgo was the scene of considerable fighting when the advancing Mongol troops besieged the Ladak king, bDe-legs rnam-rgyal, who reigned between 1640 and 1680 A.D.

Basgo, with its half-ruined temples and castles built on precipitous cliffs, and the quaint huts of the modern village that cluster between the sanctuaries and the sandstone rocks, makes a deep impression on the visitor; and I still cherish in my memory the picture of this ancient corner of westernmost Tibet. The town is justly said to contain the oldest convents of Ladak.

From Basgo, the trail leads over level stony ground to the collection of farmsteads called sNye-mo. The bungalow proved to be occupied by a party of Emopeans traveling from Leh, and we preferred to pitch our tents in the shady grove outside the bungalow.

Near to sNye-mo lie the ruins of an old fort called Chung-khar, of which only walls remain.

On the twenty-sixth of August we started at an early hour on the last seventeen miles to Leh.

The track leaves the Indus at sNye-mo and crosses a wide plateau surrounded by barren mountains. After three hours’ march, we reached the village of Phyi-dbang, famous for a monastery built by King Bkrashis rnam-rgyal (1500-1532). The monastery belongs to the ’Bri-khung-pa sect and possesses a fine Ihchkjiang or temple.

About two o’clock in the afternoon we reached the important Yellow Hat Monastery of Spi-thug (dPe-thub) built by King ’Bum-lde (fif-

19 KASHMIR-LADAK

teenth century) on a steep rock. This monastery was one of the first Yellow Hat monasteries of Ladak. It possesses a branch, the Zang-skar Monastery, just outside of Leh; and the well-known monastery of Ri-dzong (Ri-rdzong) is also connected with it.

The monastery of Spi-thug enjoys a wide reputation throughout Tibet for the austerity of its monks and the learning of its abbot. It was erected in honor of the great reformer rje-rin-po-che Tsong-kha-pa (1357-1419 A.D.) and a large-sized image of the Saint is found in its du~khang or assembly hall. We decided to visit the monastery on our way and therefore rode up the steep crag on which it stands. We had no difficulty in gaining admission and were very cordially invited in by the abbot and his assistant or umdze. We first were shown round the du-hjtang where some thirty monks were attending divine service. The walls were covered with frescoes, but the extreme darkness inside the hall prevented us from seeing much of them. Before the altar glittered several rows of offering lamps, whose twinkling light illumined from time to time the serene faces of the images.

We were entertained with tea and sweets in the private apartments of the *sku-shok* or Incarnate Lama of the monastery. The *sku-shok* himself was absent at Ri-dzong, where he was undergoing a course of instruction in Buddhist metaphysics. In his absence the monastery was administrated by Lama Lobzang, a pleasant old gentleman of quiet manners, who made a very good impression on all of us. He was one of those erudite lamas who carry in themselves centuries of religious culture.

The private rooms were neat and well furnished in Tibetan style, with painted glass cases containing clay and brass images and a small library of religious texts destined for the private use of the *sku-shok*. His mantle was thrown on his low throne standing at the northern wall of the room. After a pleasant hour spent in the company of the abbot and his assistant, we climbed to the roof of the monastery and enjoyed the magnificent view over the vast and open Indus Valley, north of which lies the capital of Ladak.

The last five miles to Leh led over a stony plain dotted here and there with small groves of trees. Leh, with its bazaar engirded by high walls, its city gates, the towering mass of the palace, and the picturesque crowd that throngs the bazaar and streets, makes a lasting impression. It is one of those towns of higher Asia, which has still preserved its character of an Asiatic caravan center to which stream numerous caravans carrying the products of India, China, Tibet, and Turkestan.

20 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

A careful archaeological study of Ladak requires prolonged residence in the country. Whatever we know of the past of the country and its monuments of antiquity, we owe to the labors of Dr. A. H. Francke and his predecessors in the Moravian Mission.

Our expedition remained in the capital of Ladak from August 26 to September 19, 1925, except for several days spent on a journey to the famous Hemis Monastery and other places of interest round the town. Much of the time during this stay was occupied by preparations for the next difficult portion of the journey across the great mountain route to Chinese Turkestan. We had to dismiss all our Kashmiri servants, who were quite unsuitable for a hard mountain journey, and engaged new, experienced men. The problem of transport also gave much anxiety, for it was imperative to get reliable caravan men and good animals. Most of the caravans which reached Leh had very poor animals requiring several weeks of recuperation.

After some search and lengthy consultations with the British aqsaqal of Leh, we signed an agreement with Nazar Bai, a Karghalik caravan man, who possessed thirty-six pack horses in good condition. He had come in July and his drove of horses had been grazing for two months in a garden outside Leh. We needed in all seventy-six pack animals to carry the expedition’s baggage, and there still remained thirty horses to be found in addition to those we already had.

Every day we went round the *serais* or resthouses for Yarkend traders, inquiring for new arrivals or starting caravans. Finally we succeeded in finding the required thirty pack horses, belonging to an Afghan trader, Omar Khan, a resident of Yarkend. His horses had come only recently from the passes and were in poor condition, but the owner promised to feed them well the remaining three weeks and to have them fit by the date of departure. We had to agree, for this was the only solution of our transport problem. On such a difficult and deserted route as the Karakorum trade route, it is always advisable to make use of hired transport and not to risk a caravan of purchased animals. The difficulties of this mountain route, its rarefied atmospheres and absolute barrenness, and the great percentage of caravan animals that perish yearly, make traveling very expensive. The prices for one pack horse range from sixty rupees to eighty rupees from Leh to Yarkend or Khotan. We fixed the price of one horse at seventy-six rupees, with the obligation of carrying the expedition’s baggage in twenty-four days from Leh to Khotan.

21 KASHMIR-LADAK

The caravan men were sturdy Turkis from Karghalik and Khotan, in large chapans or coats, soft leather boots or charuq, and large oval fur caps protecting the wearer from the bitter winds and gales of the highlands. It was strange to hear the strongly guttural sounds of the eastern Turki, so different from the soft Urdu of India and the fluent speech of Lhasa Tibetans. Some of the men knew a little Chinese, and our Chinese interpreter was able to make some sort of conversation with them.

Once the transport problem had been settled, we had more time to inspect the interesting locality of Leh and its vicinity.

The modern city of Leh is situated at the junction of several important central Asian caravan routes, hence its importance for the history of the Indian border country. At least three long and difficult routes connect Leh with Lhasa, the capital of Tibet proper. The first of them crosses the Tibetan uplands and passes north of the great lakes; Ngan-tse tsho, Chyaring tsho (Kya-ring tsho), and Nam tsho, the Tengri-nor of our maps. It joins the great Mongolia-Lhasa route in the important frontier center of Nag-chu dzong (a Tibetan dzong is the administrative center of a district and not a fortress, as is often recorded).

The second of the three routes crosses the Tibetan upland to the holy Kailasa Range and strikes south of the Great Lakes: Dangra yum-tsho, Ngan-tse, and Tengri-nor. Travelers by this route travel direct to Lhasa across the high pass of Go-ring La in the Nyen-chen Thang La Range.

The third route follows the course of the Brahmaputra and passes through Saga dzong, north of the river. From here it strikes either along the bank of the Brahmaputra to Lhartse dzong, or crosses the river and passes through Tingri on the Nepal border. In both cases the route runs through Shigatse to Lhasa. This last route is used by most of the Ladaki traders traveling to Lhasa and by the Embassy from the Maharaja of Kashmir to the Court of Lhasa.

The Karakorum route, aptly called the highest trade route in the world, connects Leh with distant China and the oases of Chinese Turkestan. Traders from Yarkend, Kashgar, and Khotan, the principal oases of southwestern Chinese Turkestan, follow it on their way to India. From Leh the central Asian caravans travel to Kashmir across the Zoji La, or through Zangskar, Lahul, the valley of Kulu and the native states of Mandi to Hoshiarpur and Amritsar, the two great emporiums of Punjab. This Turkestan trade route has increased greatly in importance during the last ten years, and the Government of India has

22 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

facilitated by several measures the passage of trading caravans over Indian territory. With the closing of the Russian frontier and the recent txnrest and civil war in western China, the Turkestan trade turned southward to India, and we found the route alive with caravan parties which were braving the icy winds and frequent avalanches on the mountain crests.

Such a favorable situation makes Leh an exceedingly interesting place for archaeological and ethnographical research. The two principal bazaars of the town are thronged by a multicolored crowd, among which the neatly attired Turkestan Turks are prominent. Huge bales of merchandise, containing Turkestan felts or nimdah, which come from Khotan, Guma, and Yarkend and command good prices on Indian markets, stand in front of the open shops. Some of these felts are very decorative in design and, as products, arc much superior to similar felts made by the Mongols or even the Chinese. In camp they are indispensable, for they serve as floor covering for tents and as bedding for the personnel of the caravans. Quite recently the export of these felts from Turkestan to India greatly increased, and this reacted favorably on the ancient industry.

The Tibetan nomads of the north bring the soft Tibetan wool out of which Kashmiri artisans make their beautiful pashmina shawls.

The caravans from Turkestan arrive usually in July and August and start on their return journey in October or even November, before the snow has closed the passes for the winter. The merchandise brought to Leh and Kashmir consists chiefly of Turkestan felts, Chinese and Khotanese silks, furs, wool, and leather products such as the Turkestan top boots and charuqs, valued so highly by the Ladaki caravan men. A considerable trade is done in horses, and Yarkend caravans usually bring with them a good number of riding horses which they drive unloaded across the passes. The hardy and swift Turkestan horse is greatly appreciated in Kashmir and the plains of India, which have never produced a country horse of its own.

The returning caravans carry loads of European-made goods: products of Manchester looms and Bradford woolen mills, British and German dyestuffs, various articles of haberdashery, and Indian products and spices, such as saffron, which is exported in great quantities from Kashmir to Turkestan and Tibet.

All this motley crowd of visitors moves, shouts, and gesticulates in the narrow streets and bazaars of Leh. Sitting on the verandah of the

23 KASHMIR-LADAK

dak bungalow one constantly hears the pleasant bells of passing caravans and the songs of the Ladaki women and men carrying grass from the fields. At times this continuous flow of men and beasts will suddenly be interrupted by the trampling of a drove of horses driven by mounted herdsmen.

In some corners of the bazaars, or in the vicinity of Lamaist temples, one meets red-clad lamas who have traveled hundreds of miles from inner Tibet, selling holy relics and talismans. Curiously enough I have seen Buddhist talismans or srung-wa on Turki caravan men from Karghalik who seemed to be quite convinced of their potency. The black and blue turbaned Baltis are very prominent in the streets of Leh and usually find employment as coolies or caravan men, carrying heavy loads. Occasionally one meets the quaint figures of the Mons, preservers of the ancient Ladaki lore and probably an ethnic remnant of a primitive population, which has been submerged by subsequent waves of foreign migrations.

During our stay in Leh, we made the acquaintance of the son of the Ladaki aqsaqal of Lhasa, a young fellow of considerable acumen, who was on a summer visit to Leh. The goods that he brought consisted of brick tea, Tibetan cloth puru, lama boots manufactured at Dre-pung, and other objects of the Lamaist cult. He even had several Tibetan xylographs for sale, prominent among which was the life story or namthar of Je-tsiin Milarepa, Tibet’s great ascetic and poet of the eleventh century A.D.

Wandering through the streets of Leh, one feels the beating pulse of the great Asia that lies hidden behind the veil of a superficial modernization.

The native Ladaki population is chiefly agricultural, and numerous farmsteads and villages lie along the Indus Valley and the vast sandy plain on which Leh is situated. In this mountainous country agriculture is possible only in the river valleys and is seldom carried on above an altitude of 12,000 feet. The scarcity of arable land, mostly represented by fluvial fans and river terraces, has limited the agricultural population to a few river valleys.

Leh, which is sometimes spelled sLel or sLes, became the permanent residence of the kings of Ladak from the time of the reign of King ’Bum-lde (fifteenth century a.d.). The antiquities of Leh consist of payees, stupas, and temples, stone carved images, and ancient graves.

When one approaches the town of Leh, one perceives from afar the

24 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

towering white mass of its great palace, erected about 1620 A.D. by King Seng'ge mam-rgyal, one of the greatest builders of Ladak; he was assisted in his work by the Lama sTag-tshang ras-chen, whom he invited to his court. (17) The palace dominates the city, and the houses that cluster round it seem like stone steps leading toward an imposing edifice or altar. The Leh Palace is said to have been built on the model of the great Potala Palace of Lhasa, and indeed there is a slight resemblance, between these two monuments of the Tibetan past. We had the good fortune of passing several days at the Palace of Leh through the courtesy of the present Raja of Ladak.

A broad road, on either side of which rise low walls of unhewn stones, leads to the famous Lion Gate of the King’s Palace. Painted wooden columns support the roof of the entrance. A large stone stairway leads to the upper rooms of the Palace. It is in a very dilapidated condition and some of the stones forming the steps have rolled down. One has to advance carefully, testing the firmness of the stones. Our servants called it "Sasseri,” comparing the stairway to the difficult mountain trail leading toward the Sasser Pass on the Karakorum route. To the right and left of the stairway gape dark holes in the walls — former doors leading to the storerooms or servant quarters. After one has climbed to the upper floor, a flash of bright light suddenly pierces the darkness of the corridor — it is a side window without a wooden frame or glass, just a square hole in the wall; climbing the stairway in complete darkness at night one has to be very careful not to fall out of this window. A little farther on, one enters a vast hall with an earthen floor. Round the walls stretches a kind of portico supported by wooden columns, painted in bright colors and carved. The walls are adorned with numerous images of the green Tara. From here a few stone steps lead to the next floor, where the living quarters are situated. These are typical Tibetan rooms with wooden frames in the large square windows and carved columns that support the ceiling. The doors are massive, with huge iron keys and iron plaques that serve as ornaments. From one of the rooms a passage leads to the roof of the Palace, from which opens a unique view of the city lying at the foot of the Palace, the snowy peaks of the mountain range on the southern side of the Indus Valley, and the wind-swept ridge of the Khardong La over which hover light clouds, the messengers of approaching storm.

At sunset, the whole of the sandy plain and the sand rock mountains that rise on either side of it light up with an intense glow. The town below plunges into a deep violet mist and the rows of white stupas on the plain sparkle like necklaces of precious stones. During this hour the Ladaki men and women tell their evening prayers, and incense smoke rises slowly above every house on the plain. It is during this hour of peace and prayer that the visitor to the capital of the little kingdom begins to understand the intrinsic beauty of the country and the irresistible force of attraction it exercises on its sons.

From the roof of the Palace one descends by another stairway to the small royal chapel of the Palace. An officiating priest guards the sacred images and lights the offering lamps of the altar. The principal figure is that of Dug-kar, the Saviouress. The figure is the work of a Ladak artist, who has acquitted himself of his task with considerable success. The thousand-armed goddess holds numerous symbols that reveal to the devotee the omnipotent nature of the deity. Round the walls of the small chapel hang numerous banners, some of which seem to be old and are extremely interesting on account of their style. As Ladak is situated at the junction of several highways of Asia, its art and culture bear an imprint of cosmopolitanism. Some of the painted banners evince a decisive Indo-Persian style, and many of the details seem to be taken from a Mogul miniature. Others again strongly remind one of the great pictorial compositions of Chinese Turkestan. We spent considerable time studying the many painted banners under the flickering light of a candle, for it seemed a profanation to disturb the somber chapel with the bright and sharp light of a flashlight.

Unfortunately the Palace was not the ideal quarter for an expedition with hundreds of cases and bales, which need packing and distribution into pony loads. After several days spent in the fantastic surroundings of the ancient abode of Ladaki kings, we were obliged to return to our former headquarters at the dak bungalow, where we had plenty of space to arrange the pony loads and keep our saddle horses.

The oldest palace of Leh is situated on the steep rock rNam-rgyal rtse-mo behind the town, and is said to have been erected by King bKra-shis rnam-rgyal (*ca*. 1520 A.D.). Now only ruins remain of this ancient structure, and some of its walls have been used for the construction of the present monastery on the hill.

Below the hill lies the small hamlet of Chubi, which was founded by the same bKra-shis rnam-rgyal.

26 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

The present Raja of Ladak dwells in his summer residence at sTog. He receives a small annual pension and leads a retired life. He seldom visits the town and resides in his great town palace only during the New Year feftivities. His aged father has embraced monkhood and devotes his life to religious work. He is a serene and dignified gentleman, learned in the sacred lore of his country. When he paces down the streets of Leh on his rare visits to the town, many of the people throw themselves down before him and thus greet the scion of the ancient house of Kesar.

The temples and monasteries of Leh are prominent features of the town itself and its neighborhood. The oldest temple is situated on the rNam-rgyal rtse-mo Hill and is dedicated to Maitreya. According to tradition it was built by King ’Bum-lde.*® On the same hill is foimd the interesting temple called mGon-khang and dedicated to the Lords or Dharmapalas of the Four Quarters. It was erected by King bKra-shis rnam-rgyal, the builder of the Palace on the same hill, and of the hamlet Chubi. The temple contains frescoes whose importance is enhanced by the fact that their dates may be given. In the history of Tibetan pictorial art we are sadly lacking in definite dates to fix the different periods of the artistic evolution of the country. We speak of the different foreign influences which affected the art of Tibet, but are unable to place them in time. Therefore it is always gratifying to find frescoes or paintings which can be definitely dated. I hope to devote a separate work to the wall paintings found in Tibetan monasteries; like everything in Ladak, they evince a strong composite nature, and the artist or artists who executed them were inspired not only by the canonical art of Tibet but were also strongly influenced by the secular art of neighboring countries. Very striking is the fresco representing the family of Ladak kings. The men are attired in Mogul fashion, but the queens are depicted wearing the national Ladak dress. The fresco shows the duality that still exists in the culture of present-day Ladak.

Below the royal palace of Seng-ge rnam-rgyal stand two temples — one consecrated to the future Buddha Maitreya, the other to Avalokitesvara, the Divine Patron of Tibet. The temple or lha-\hang of Maitreya, besides containing a huge image of the Future Buddha, has old and interesting frescoes. One of them represents the Meditative or Dhyani-Buddhas wearing the princely attire of bodhisattvas. Close to these temples lie the ruins of the house of a former minister of Ladak (bKa-

blon). Old clay images and manuscript books are still to be found in the ruins.

North of Leh is situated the small monastery of Zangskar, a branch of the Spi-thug Monastery. It is of comparatively recent date but contains some well-executed images and frescoes. A square courtyard paved with large slabs of stone leads to the chief temple, standing in front of the entrance gate. The first room of the temple contains a clay image of Avalokitesvara, the Merciful Lord. The walls of the temple are covered with modern frescoes of fine execution, painted by a well-known Ladak artist, now an old man residing at the Trikshe Monastery. Behind the first hall is situated a small chapel consecrated to the worship of Dug-kar. Besides the goddess’ image we found a large image of Manjushri or Jam-pe yang, the Prince of Knowledge. The rest of the monastery buildings in the courtyard are occupied by cells and storerooms.

A place well-worth visiting is the town residence of the Hemis *sku-shok* or abbot of the well-known Hemis Monastery. It is in charge of a nyer-wa or housekeeper. The s\u-sho\ only seldom resides in it and most of the year the house stands empty. It is a typical Tibetan mansion, and the upper rooms command a fine view of the Indus Valley and the snowy mountains beyond it. As usual the ground floor is reserved for stables, servants’ quarters, and storerooms. On the second floor is situated the kitchen, a cleanly kept place with huge shining brass cauldrons and other kitchen utensils. The living quarters are on the upper floor. These are airy rooms with large square windows. Only one room had glass in the windows, the other had beautifully carved window frames but neither glass nor paper.

Some of the private houses of Leh contain interesting frescoes in the living rooms. In one such house I remember having seen frescoes illustrating the life of Je-tsun Milarepa, his encounter with the Bon magician Naropa on the holy Kailasa Mountain, and other equally famous episodes of the Saint’s life. The same room had another very curious fresco representing the Emperor of China and the arrival of a Ladaki embassy to the Imperial Court of China. Unfortunately there was no inscription to explain or date the painting. The owner of the house called the fresco *rGyn-nag-gi* *kong-ma chen-po*, i.e., "The Emperor of China." It is the second historical fresco which I found in Ladak. No doubt there exist others. The art of fresco painting is still cultivated in Ladak and the Ladaki artists produce sometimes works of art which

28 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

compare favorably to those of the central Tibetan school, with its rigidity of composition and design.

In the village of Changspa, situated in the vicinity of Leh, Dr. Francke has discovered interesting frescoes illustrating one of the important episodes of the Kesar Saga. The wall paintings are found in the summer residence of a family of bKa-blon or ministers. They represent the war of Jang or IJang-dmag, a country in the east of Tibet against which King Kesar waged war. Kesar frescoes are extremely rare throughout Tibet, and it is gratifying to know that Dr. Francke had those of Changspa copied.

The capital of Ladak abounds in *stupas*, *mani*-walls or *men-dongs*, and stone-cut images. On the large plain outside Leh stands the longest *mani*-wall of the country, with large stupas on its extremities. It was built by King Del-dan rnam-rgyal (1620-40 A.D.). The Ladak stupas are characterized by painted stucco figures on their foundations. Sometimes these represent winged horses, lions, peacocks, or swans. Rock-cut images abound in Leh and along the trails that lead to the town. At the village of Changspa are found two important stone images, one representing the Buddha Sakyamuni and the other the Future Buddha. Sakyamuni is depicted standing with both hands making the sign of instruction (dharmacakra-mudra). The Buddha is assisted by Maitreya and Padmapani, represented on either side of the chief figure. The second figure represents Maitreya holding the rosary and the vase or bum-pa. It is interesting to note that the Ladak images of Maitreya all hold the rosary in the right hand, instead of the stalk of the lotus flower, as is the case on central Tibetan bronzes. The rosary seems to belong to an older tradition. On the route to Khardong Pass stands a stone image of Maitreya holding the rosary in his right hand and the vase in his left.

A separate and curious group of monuments is formed by the Maltese crosses with inscriptions found in the vicinity of Drang-tse, a village on the Pangkong Lake. The inscriptions accompanying the cross figures were recognized to be Soghdian. It remains to be determined during what period these crosses were erected and the reason that they are found in such a remote place as Drang-tse on the Pangkong-tsho. It seems very probable that there existed a floating Nestorian Christian population in Ladak during the eighth to tenth centuries A.D. when Nestorian colonies were numerous along the trade routes of Turkestan, and other regions of central Asia. Whether the Nestorian visitors to

29 KASHMIR-LADAK

Ladak were merchants or pilgrims, it is impossible to determine at present. In the country round Ladak and Kashmir are found curious legends of a Christian character, which are at present current among the Mohammedan population of the two provinces. They may be remnants of a Nestorian past. The Nestorian Christians were known all over central Asia under the name of *ärkägün-arghun*, and it is interesting to note that the half-caste population of Ladak, born of a Turki father and a Ladaki mother, is designated by the same word pronounced *arghun*. (19) The Nestorians were known in the Mongol Empire under the name of Tarsa and Ärkägün. The origin of *ärkägün* is difficult to establish.

Islam is served in Leh by the large mosque at the upper end of the bazaar. It was probably erected after Nawab Fatehkhan’s march to Ladak.

Several of the so-called ancient Dard graves at Teu-gser-po, a place about two miles above the British Joint-Commissioner’s bungalow, have been excavated by the missionaries, and were found to contain low masonry walls of unhewn stones, somewhat like a subterranean chamber, handmade pottery with linear ornaments, and small bronze objects, beads, etc. Some of the pots were filled with human bones. This fact seems to indicate that the people who built these graves were in the habit of cutting up the body and depositing the bones and flesh in jars.

It is as yet impossible to determine what people constructed the Leh graves. Dr. Francke believes them to have been Dards. (20) All the skulls so far discovered were distinctly dolichocephalic, whereas modern Tibetans of Ladak are brachycephalic. The Tibetans are a composite race, and I have collected during my stay among the nomads of Tibet a number of facts which show that there once existed an ancient stratum of dolichocephalic population in Tibet. The nomad tribes of the Tibetan border country still show dolichocephalic and brachycephalic indexes. The results of my investigations can be summarized thus: the Hor-pas of the Thang La region — mostly dolichocephalic; the Panags, Goloks, and Nya-rong-was — numerous dolichocephalic skulls, the same being true of the Northern Kham Province; the Chang-pas of the lake region — ^mostly brachycephalic indexes, some showing a transitional type; the agricultural population of the Brahmaputra Valley and south-eastern Tibet — ^mostly brachycephalic indexes. It is clear from the above

19\.  Pelliot: *Chritiens d'Asie Centrale et d'Extreme Orient. T'oung Pao*., XV, 636.

20\.  *Ibid*., I, 68 II.

30 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

that the dolichocephalic population had been preserved along the Tibetan border, whereas the center of the country had been conquered at some early date by a brachycephalic race. I am inclined to think that the graves at Teu-gscr-po were left by the ancient stratum of dolichocephalic tribes of Tibet. It is interesting to note that the Leh graves are popularly called “nomad graves,” and it is precisely among the nomad population that we find the dolichocephalic type with fine features and straight hair. Unfortunately the missionaries were obliged to stop their excavations and a great many of these graves are still unexplored. It will be very instructive to compare the Ladak graves to the analogous graves foimd in the lake region north of the Trans-Himalayas.

The famous Hemis Monastery has often been described in books about the country, and the religious dances that take place at the monastery about the end of June have been attended by many Europeans. Although of comparatively recent date, the monastery contains some old bronzes. The frescoes in the temples are modern, and as such have only an iconographical value.

The road along the Indus Valley is extremely picturesque. The vivid green of its fields appears in sharp contrast to the ruggedness of its mountains. The village of Shel on the right bank of the river was once the capital of the Ladak Kingdom and is notable for ancient rock inscriptions and stone-cut images. The Yellow Hat Monastery of Tik-tse (Khrig-rtse), situated on a steep crag, is interesting for its romantic situation, but it looks forlorn. It is populated by a crowd of dirty and insolent monks, who impudently clamor for bahjhish and lack' the discipline and monastic dignity found in their colleagues of Spi-thug and Ri-dzong. The Incarnate Lama was obliged to quit the monastery some years ago, for monastic life possessed no attractions for him. A new incarnation did not appear, and the whole establishment was left to itself. We succeeded in finding some old bronzes and several old painted banners. Some of the temple doors had interesting wood carvings. The colossal figure of the Future Buddha, lit by numerous offering lamps, made a powerful impression; but the heaps of rubbish in the corners of the edifice and the thick layer of dust on objects of worship only enhanced the first sense of the forlorn state of the monastery. No doubt many interesting objects could be found, but the state of utter disorganization prevents the student from making a careful inspection of the monastery buildings.

The autumn was rapidly setting in. Yellow leaves in the gardens ana

the frequent breaths of cold wind from the mountain summits made us realize that it was advisable to hurry our departure. For several days the town had been filled with reports that snowstorms were beginning on the high passes and our caravan-*bashis* pressed us to start before the early snow would block the passes. Professor Roerich had completed his series of paintings on Ladak and its sanctuaries, and we could begin our final preparations for the difficult journey ahead of us. We were short of men, and it seemed very difficult to engage suitable ones for the long journey to Khotan. We sent a notice to the bazaars that men were needed, and daily crowds of them came to the dak bungalow. Out of this motley collection of Baltis, Ladakis, Kashmiris, Arghuns, and Turkis, Mrs. Roerich chose several promising men, who proved very helpful on our track to Chinese Turkestan. Two of them had the distinction of serving under Dr. Sven Hedin during his expedition of 1907-8, and several others had been previously employed as caravan men on the Karakorum route. They all knew the way well and were fully prepared to face the difficulties and dangers of the mountain journey. Most of them had been several times in Yarkend or Khotan and spoke fluently the eastern Turki. We engaged them as far as Khotan and promised to pay their journey home. Besides his pay each of the men received a warm fur coat, a winter fur cap, and a pair of soft charuq boots with felt socks. Two tents were provided to shelter the personnel of the expedition during the night, but for the whole of the journey many of the men preferred to sleep in the open or under the flies of our own tents.

The son of a local Ladak headman was accompanying us as head servant and proved a devoted and efficient man. Ladakis are wonderful in caravans, always cheerful amid hardships and storms, contented with little, and always ready to perform their work. They march on foot long distances over hard, stony ground that renders animals lame, and yet never complain of fatigue. In our subsequent wanderings, we often remembered our Ladaki caravan men and their devoted service.

### FROM LEH TO KHOTAN THE GREAT KARAKORUM ROUTE

II

FROM LEH TO KHOTAN

THE GREAT KARAKORUM ROUTE

SEPTEMBER 19, 1925 — a memorable day in the annals of the expedition! A fine autumn morning with a light breeze from the mountains, wonderfully cool and refreshing. A large crowd of local inhabitants gathered to see us start. The crossing of the Khardong Pass, the first mountain pass on the Turkestan route, is usually effected on yaks, which have to be hired from local peasants. The summit of the pass is covered by a glacier and the pack horses have usually a bad time on it. When pack yaks are employed, the pack horses and mules of the caravans are driven empty across the pass. This is the usual custom of the country, no doubt prompted by many years of experience. We decided to follow it and had ordered yaks several days in advance. For some reason or other, only half of the required forty yaks appeared in the early morning at the dak bungalow. We were obliged to wait the whole of the morning and a considerable portion of the afternoon, before all the woolly beasts reached the bungalow’s compound. As is customary, there was much hustle and shouting, the local Ladak headman using his cane rather freely.

At last, about fovir o’clock in the afternoon, the long caravan column left the dak bungalow and filled the narrow road, which passes at the foot of the Leh Palace and leads to the small village of dGon-pa, and farther into the mountains. A large crowd followed us on foot, wishing us a successful journey. We rode past the barley fields and the Zangskar Convent, whose white walls are an outstanding feature on the plain north of Leh.

After we had passed the last Ladaki village and barley fields, a group of Ladaki women and girls approached our column. They held in their hands brimming cups of yak milk. We all had to bow low in our saddles, and our foreheads and those of our animals were sprinkled with milk. In doing so they wished us godspeed and a safe journey amid the dangers of the forbidding Karakorum.

For three hours we climbed the mountain. With each step, the coun-

36 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

try became more and more barren. The verdant gardens and fields of Ladak lay behind; and ahead of us towered the rugged mountains, their crests covered with glaciers and snow. Large bowlders hung over the mountain slopes, and we crossed vast masses of debris carried down the towering heights. Our caravan of pack horses under Nazar Bai and Omar Khan went ahead, with orders to wait for us at the northern side of the Khardong La in the small hamlet of Khalsar.

We camped for the night on a stonypromontory, close to a ruined stone hut. A piercing northwest wind started soon after we had dismounted and we were obliged to seek shelter among the neighboring cliffs. Our men, perched under the rocks in their gray sheepskins, looked like gigantic vultures, gazing over the upland for some prey. The yak caravan reached the spot only about ten o’clock at night. Its approach was heralded by the loud shouting and whistling of the drivers. Soon there appeared a dark moving mass, that slowly filled the open space on the small plateau of our camp. In complete darkness we began imloading and our inexperienced camp men had some difficulties in putting up the tents. The night was bitterly cold and the wind blew continuously, abating only toward dawn.

The fine morning of September 20 was a distinct contrast to the previous dismal evening. The caravan was soon on the march, and the long black file of animals climbed the mountain path. We all rode yaks and our cavalry saddles looked strange on the shaggy black animals. The yaks arc wonderful climbers, and many travelers have spoken highly of these beasts of the mountains. The ascent of the Khardong La is comparatively easy, but a little too steep for horses. It took us fully three hours to reach the snow-capped summit of the pass. On many a turn we noticed frozen drops of blood — signs of passing caravans. Men and animals often bleed heavily at these altitudes. From the summit of the pass, the mountains seemed like a great sea, crowned with sparkling white foam.

The descent was steep and slippery. A glacier lay along the northern slope. We all had to dismount and walk down the pass. One of our pack yaks preferred to glide down the glacier and with amazing agility dashed down its steep slope. We all were sure that it would crash with its load against the huge bowlders that filled the narrow ravine below. But the animal suddenly turned at the critical point and self-contentedly joined its comrades on the trail. We had to walk a considerable distance down the pass. Far in the distance, a tiny green strip of vegeta-

37 FROM LEH TO KHOTAN

tion indicated the Shayok Valley, where lay the village of Khalsar, the meeting place of our caravan. We did not mount our horses, but continued our journey on yaks. After two hours’ ride, we entered the Shayok Valley with its verdant bottom and sharply outlined rocks. For the last five miles, the road was flat and easy. About five o’clock in the afternoon, we were within view of the village of Khalsar, and soon noticed our czrzvaxi-bashis, Nazar Bai and Omar Khan, waiting for us outside the village. Two hours later we were encamped in the small but shady garden of the serai and were checking up our loads, as they arrived on yaks. From then on, for twenty-two days, the horses had to carry the loads and climb the forbidding heights of the mountain passes.

Next day, September 21, we continued our march along the Shayok Valley. The country was gorgeous in its coloring — flaming yellow and red sandstone rocks and granites rose above the bright green spots of the valley bottom.

Three miles above Khalsar, we crossed a suspension bridge, and rode as far as the picturesque village of Tirit. Here our headman Lön-po possessed an estate and a large arid comfortable country house. He was very anxious to accord us hospitality and made us stay for the night. The upper rooms of the house were clean and bright. The walls were gaily decorated with paintings, representing the eight happy signs of Tibetan religious ornamentation. The view from the roof of the house was superb and late into the night we enjoyed the magnificent moonlight which illumined the whole of the surrounding mountain country and the peaceful valley of the Shayok. The caravan men, unmindful of the hardships and privations ahead, sang around their camp fires, and the evening psalms of our Buddhist followers intermingled with the drawling melancholy songs of Turkestan.

We were anxious to reach Panamik, the last settlement on the Karakorum route, and rose early on September 22, before dawn had aroused the mountains, still hidden by a night-veil.

Soon after Tirit the road turned into the valley of Nubra and led past numerous farmsteads, hamlets, and monasteries. It was lively with the sound of caravan bells; strings of horses and donkeys wearily moved toward Ladak. They were accompanied by dusty drivers, with their faces blackened by the winds and gales of the uplands. Days of hard traveling were behind them and they were hurrying to Leh to enjoy a much-needed rest.

38 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

On our way we visited the interesting monastery of Sandoling, which is only seldom mentioned in books on Ladak. The trail crossed the dry bed of a torrent, strewn with bowlders that once were swept from the mountain side. The assembly hall of the monastery contained a large image of Maitreya and fine large painted banners representing the same bodhisattva. The convent possesses the finest collection of religious banners which we had seen in Ladak. The head lama of the monastery was absent and the young novices were slow and lazy in the discharge of their religious duties.

We reached Panamik in the evening and pitched our camp in a grove of trees on the banks of a small brook, which suddenly rose and flooded the banks, endangering our camp.

In Panamik we learned that two sahibs were stopping in the village. Shortly after, they came to see us, and proved to be two missionaries from the Swedish Mission in Kashgar. One of them. Rev. Mr. Germanson, told us of the difficulties on the road. The conditions in Kashgar were not altogether peaceful and the city was still agitated after the coup d’Hat of Captain Ma and the assassination of the all-powerful G.O.C. of Kashgar, the dreaded Ma Fu-hsin.

In the neighborhood of Panamik there were several chapels and a small Red sect monastery. Rock-cut images were said to exist higher up the valley, but we lacked the time to make a side excursion.

The next stage, on September 23, brought us to the foot of the Karaul-davan, a small pass with avalanche-swept stone slopes. The day’s route followed along the left bank of the Nubra River and we could see distant villages on the right bank of the stream. An interesting corner of Ladak is this Nubra Valley.

We camped on the edge of a plateau strewn with bowlders and much detritus. A Ladak caravan with yaks, bound for Kokyar and Yarkend, was camping beside us. Yak caravans are well suited for the mountain route of Karakorum, and their only drawback is the shortness of their daily stages.

Long before dawn we heard the loud cries of "Long, long, long!" — “Arise, arise, arise!” — in the Ladaki camp, and camp fires soon flashed in the dark, showing shaggy figures drinking their morning tea and tsam-pa (parched barley flour). In the twilight, the dark mass of the yak caravan left the camp site and started for the pass. We followed it on our horses. The trail up the pass presented no difficulties, but the precipitous stone slopes and the numerous skeletons of men who had

39 FROM LEH TO KHOTAN

fallen on the sharp rocks below spoke of the dangers of the pass. Our caravan had also to pay its toll. The line Badakhshani stallion belonging to Omar Khan, frightened by something, jumped suddenly and instantly crashed down the stone slope. It landed on the rocks beneath, still alive. A bullet from one of our rifles put an end to its agony.

The descent from the pass is short and gradual, but the further route along the valley of a small rivulet is a dreadful accumulation of bowlders and detritus. It is almost incomprehensible how caravans can cross this stretch of the road! Bowlders, sharp stones, and treacherous holes, without foothold — such is the road after the Karaul-davan. For three hours we struggled through this stony mass, dismounting to help our horses over the dangerous places. The swift cold rivulet had to be crossed several times. It was hard to induce horses to enter the icy water. One of our sheep, driven along with the caravan, was carried away by the current, and could not be rescued. Utterly exhausted, we camped on a level patch of land. It was our intention to reach the foot of the Sasser Pass the same day, but Omar Khan reported that his pack horses were at the end of their strength and could hardly move farther.

The camp was a very dismal one. In addition to the wind, wet snow drifted in the air; and the dark slopes of the mountains, rising on all sides of the small valley where we camped, made a dreary impression on us all. Our Chinese interpreter smoked his pipe, repeating wistfully: "Aya, Aya, such a road, such a road! Nowhere in Tibet did I see such roads." In the evening two of our pack horses ate some poisonous grass and succumbed during the night. Their loads had to be distributed on the remaining animals. We warned the caravan men to be more careful and to tie the animals up wherever there was danger of poisonous grass.

September 25, 1925. We made a short march up the valley at the foot of the Sasser Pass (17,500 feet) whose snowy mass towered northwest of our camp. Soon after our arrival, it began to snow and a sharp piercing wind roared on the heights of the mountains, rapidly sweeping down the narrow valley. After a few seconds the entire landscape was enveloped in a whirl of snow and we all were sitting buried in it, our backs turned to the raging wind. The snow had to be shoveled away and the tents pitched in all haste, a task by no means easy at an altitude of some 15400 feet.

The night was without wind and exceptionally quiet. Our horses roamed about the camp seeking some signs of weathered grass that iJhowed here and there from beneath the snow. In the morning we

40 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

woke up to find ourselves and our tents covered deep. The snow had continued for the whole of the night and thick mists hid the crest of the pass. Omar Khan was completely disheartened by the loss of three of his best animals and viewed the prospect with much apprehension. His colleague, Nazar Bai, on the contrary, was cheerful and only expressed the wish that we had crossed the pass a day earlier, before the beginning of the snow blizzard. This indeed had been the suggestion of Mrs. Roerich, who the previous day had insisted that we reach the foot of the Sasser Pass. Nazar Bai’s horses were strong and well fed and he could risk long and trying marches across snowbound passes. Omar Khan was in quite a different position. His horses were comparatively weak and his caravan men a turbulent lot. In the caravan, much depends on the drivers who look after the horses, load them, and follow them on the march. A bad and reckless caravan man will often ruin the animals intrusted to his charge and will never think of helping them over difficult places. We urged Omar Khan to try his best to be careful of his animals and not to allow them to graze on the poisonous grass that abounds in the mountains.

To add to our difficulties, the iron tent pegs proved to be frozen hard into the ground and it was almost impossible to pull them loose. Our Ladaki servants took the situation easily, and after two hours of exertion succeeded in extricating all the pegs. Now I perceive the difference between the caravan men on the Karakorum route and those of Tibet proper. The caravan men of the Karakorum aim at making the journey as quickly as possible, in order to spend only a short period of days on the bleak uplands. Neither storm nor snow will stop them, and they will fight nature, prompted by an impetuous desire to reach the goal. The caravan men of Tibet are of a much more indolent nature. Their way is to proceed slowly. A storm and snowfall are pretexts for a day’s rest. They have no goal ahead and their inner self is as doleful as the undulating plains and hills of their highlands.

By ten o’clock the caravan began to ascend the pass. For an hour the sun lighted the snow-covered summits and the vast snowy expanses of the mountain slopes were a mass of sparkling colors. We could hardly look ahead of us, so intense was the glow of the snow in the sun. Everyone had to put on snow goggles. A cold blast of wind brought a sudden and sharp change. A small cloud was seen rising on the summit of the pass; it grew nearer and nearer and in a few moments our column was enveloped in a severe snow blizzard. Notwithstanding the terrific force

41 FROM LEH TO KHOTAN

of the wind that raged around us, raising huge clouds of snow, we hurried on.

On the very edge of the pass the trail was blocked by the carcass of a recently fallen horse which we had to remove in order to go by. The carcass had already been attacked by ravens, huge black birds that haunt the vicinity of the trade route. When a dying animal is abandoned by a caravan, these dismal birds of prey hover round it, pluck out its eyes before it has even died, and feast on its entrails.

The summit of the Sasser Pass was covered by huge glaciers. To cross, one has to ride for more than two hours over the slippery surface. Fortunately for us, the glacier was buried under deep snow, but even then my horse slipped terribly and almost carried me down a crevasse.

In the arctic solitude of the summit, we came across a few bales of merchandise piled in a heap, with the name of the owner on them. A caravan had passed this way, and after losing most of its animals, had to abandon some of its loads. Such piles are frequently met on the way; nobody touches them, and the owner usually finds them on his way back.

The carcasses of animals became more and more numerous. Some of them had probably died in terrible agony. The dry atmosphere had mummified them in strange attitudes, as though galloping, their heads thrown backward. Probably some caravaneers had set up the dead carcasses in standing posture and there was something strangely uncanny in these galloping, dead horses.

One of our men had an attack of mountain sickness and fell from his horse not far from the summit of the pass. He was bleeding severely and had to be treated. For a brief moment, the sun ray pierced the dense clouds that enveloped the snowy summits, and the whole of the snowy region sparkled with an intense and unbearable glow. The men covered their faces and the animals’ eyes were watery from the terrible glare.

Finally, we reached the northern edge of the glacier, and began the long-awaited descent. A barren black mountain country stretched northward. A long, gradual decline leads to the Sasser Serai, a miserable looking blockhouse with several stone inclosures. Quite unexpectedly, we saw some large Bactrian camels grazing on the scant shrubs that covered the almost bare slopes. These hardy animals belonged to one of our caravan-^ar^/r, Omar Khan, and were grazing iiere until a caravan of horses should bring loads to be carried to Tur-

42 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

kestan. Camels carry loads across the Karakorum as far as the Sasser Serai. Here they have to stop, because the slippery glacier cap of the pass is impracticable for them. Some of our Ladakis had never seen camels before and there were endless exclamations of "*A-tsi tindre*," or "O such ones !" — а common Tibetan exclamation of surprise. Many of our riding horses, especially those from Zangskar and Ladak, snorted and turned backward.

We continued our descent until we again reached the Shayok Valley, where the river carried its waters across a gravel-covered mountain plain. The weather suddenly brightened and the sandrocks of the valley burst into flame in the rays of the setting sun. A wonderful scene indeed, after the arctic severity of the snowbound pass!

A small party of Yarkend pilgrims to Mecca went by our camp on their way back to Turkestan. They traveled with only a few pack horses and all the men were on horseback. Two women with black veils that hid their faces were riding behind the party. They crossed the river and disappeared in the sandy hills on the other side. A few days afterward we found two dead horses — a trace of their rapid passage.

September 27, 1925. The night was cold and the river was covered with a thin crust of ice. After some search along the bank, we found a fording place and with loud shouts urged our horses to enter the water. The thin ice cut the horses’ legs and they plunged into the cold water very unwillingly. It reached up to the stirrups. Our caravan drivers, who always went on foot, were carried across on riding horses, seated behind the rider.

Once across the river, we hurried our horses to warm theni after the cold batlu Beyond the gravel bottom of the river valley lay rocky hills. The route led through a narrow canyon of crystalline rocks. At the bottom of the canyon flowed a tiny stream that lost itself in the gravel plain before reaching the river. The narrow trail along the bank was blocked here and there by horse carcasses and, what was worse, by huge carcasses of camels with horribly swollen bellies, that filled the path completely. The Turkestan caravaneers are accustomed to cut the throats of dying animals with large knives, thus ending their agony. Our caravan animals snorted, and the frozen carcasses had to be removed from the trail.

We came out of the canyon into a region of undulating hills of black earth with very marshy ground. Small pools of water stood in the shallow depressions between the hills. The country gradually rose and we

43 FROM LEH TO KHOTAN

soon emerged on a broad upland plain. Snowy mountains rose on either side of it. We camped near a small brook of fresh water. The air was frosty and the pools and small depressions were all covered by a thin crust of ice.

September 28. An intensely cold night made us shiver in our sleeping bags. The early morning hours were indescribable in their solemn beauty. The surrounding snowy peaks stood in sharp dazzling outline against the opal sky of simrise. Oiu: caravan, in several columns, made its way across the upland plain — Nazar Bai always ahead, Omar Khan moving slowly in the rear. The vast expanse of the plain was soon behind us and the track led into a red sandstone gorge with flat gravel bottom. A mighty stream had once flowed down the gorge, and the rocks on the mountain slopes bore numerous traces of its action. In this gorge we saw our first Tibetan gazelles, light-footed animals that dashed across the trail to disappear again in the distance.

For the greater part of the day, we followed gravel-covered valley bottoms. On all sides rose crystalline rocks. The march was a very long one — almost ten hours, but over fairly level ground. After sunset we camped on the bank of a tiny stream which carried its silver water into the gravel-covered valley. mmediately north of the camp rose the Dapsang Pass, and behind it the vast upland known as the Plain of Dapsang. Completely fatigued, we were glad to find ourselves in our tents. I was about to crawl into my bag, when suddenly my nose detected a slight smell of putrid flesh. From where could it come ? A search revealed the fact that while I was busy with our riding horses, distributing the forage for the night, our camp men had pitched my tent on a bloodstained spot on which lay the remains of a horse carcass devoured by wolves. I had to move my tent with the help of our night guard to another spot. Such cases happen only too often on the Karakorum route. The caravans are in the habit of camping always on one and the same spots, which are marked by numerous carcasses.

We moved off very early in order to cross the Dapsang Pass and cover as much as possible of the broad Dapsang Plain that lies beyond the pass. Not far from our camp we were disagreeably surprised to discover that the “pure” mountain stream, the water of which we drank the evening before, was flowing under the carcass of a huge camel that lay in the very center of it.

The Dapsang Plain was a vast undulating upland plain, rising to a great altitude. On the southwest and southeast rose mighty, snowy

44 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

giants, among which the Dapsang Peak towered to a height of some 22,000 feet. To the west, an imposing snowy mass of several giant peaks rose toward the great heights of the Masherbrum and other peaks of its group. Ahead of us, dark rocky hills hid behind the main chain of the Karakorum. On our way, we passed a stone with a Latin inscription erected by the Italian expedition of Dr. de Filippi in 1914-15. A story is told that the Italian explorers buried hundreds of treasure cases here.

Our catxvi^VL-bashi, Nazar Bai, hoped to reach the Karakorum Pass the same day and therefore hurried our caravan on. Omar Khan complained bitterly; and in view of the poor condition of his horses we had to halt for the night at a spot two miles distant from the pass, that lay hidden behind a mountain spur.

We had intended to travel by the Kokyar route to Yarkend and then to Khotan. Nazar Bai strongly advocated the alternate route across the Sanju Pass and we decided to follow his advice. The Sanju route was shorter by six days and there were fewer streams to cross.

September 30. A blizzard had been blowing from early morning and the mountain summits were hidden behind a thick white mist. The ascent to the great Karakorum Pass (18,694 gradual and the pass itself was more like a low ridge on the surrounding high upland.

The cold was so intense that we had to cover our faces to protect them from the biting wind and the icy particles that drifted in the air and cut the skin. Mrs. Roerich always found a particular charm in this wild mountain scenery. She stood the journey wonderfully well, and our Chinese interpreter daily wondered at her courage and endurance.

One of our pack horses suddenly collapsed at the very summit. Well-fed animals often perish on mountain trails. It is always advisable not to feed the horses the day before crossing a high pass. This is the universal custom throughout higher Asia. The same rule applies to men. Less food and drink makes the crossing of a high mountain pass easier and less dangerous.

We descended from the pass into a broad valley watered by a tiny stream. A small camel caravan journeyed by toward the pass. They were pilgrims to distant Mecca. A rider in a large, heavy sheepskin coat, led the column. He bowed low in his saddle, greeting our party. A gray-bearded man sat on one of the camels, and several women mounted on other caravan animals peered out from their heavy veils.

We continued our journey to a place called Balti-brangsa, a place of-

45 FROM LEH TO KHOTAN

ten used as a camp by passing caravans and covered with carcasses and bones. We made only a brief halt and then started again in order to reach Baksum-Bulak. Balti-brangsa was situated at the foot of a low ridge, south of a shallow depression in the surrounding upland plain; the lowest point of the depression was occupied by a small lake.

A strong northwest wind was driving the clouds, and the ground was covered by several inches of snow that had fallen the night before. Late in the afternoon we reached Baksum-Bulak and camped on a level gravel plain. The surrounding mountains were all buried under snow, and an impenetrable mist made it impossible to ascertain the character of the neighborhood. In the evening we were joined by another trading caravan on its way to Kokyar and Karghalik; it had unusually fine pack animals and was traveling with great speed. The caravaneers were a fine lot of men who went about their daily occupations with a remarkable sense of duty.

The next march brought us across a series of upland plains covered here and there by patches of snow. On one of these plains, we suddenly scented in the cold air the thin perfume of Indian spices and saffron. We rode ahead and soon discovered a small donkey caravan, carrying loads of Indian spices from which the strong smell emanated. After an eight hours’ march we reached the junction of the Kokyar and Sanju routes. It is a vast gravel plain bordered on the north by a mighty snow mountain. Behind this snowy giant lay the summer grazing grounds of the mountain Kirghiz. The trading caravan, which had stayed with us at Baksum-Bulak, continued their journey toward the northwest and soon disappeared in the trembling atmosphere of the Asiatic highland. A violent northwest wind prevented the pitching of our camp and we had to wait until sunset, when its force abated a little.

October 2. Nazar Bai was eager to cross the Suget Pass (17,000 feet) the same day and to reach the Chinese frontier outposts of Suget Karaul as quickly as possible. We broke camp very early, about six o’clock in the morning, and plunged into the mountains across the plain. For several hours we followed the course of a small rivulet that flowed from the pass and disappeared in the gravel plain southwest of the massive eminence. The ascent to the pass was very gradual. The southern slope was free from snow. The landscape presented a succession of ridges, along the edge of which wound the path. The summit of the pass was broad and flat, covered with numerous bowlders. To the east and west rose great snowy peaks towering to a height of some 20,000 feet. Before

46 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

we had reached the summit of the pass, a violent cold wind accompanied by a snow blizzard greeted us. The surrounding moimtains disappeared behind a thick veil of mist, and one could only dimly see the men moving immediately ahead. On reaching the northern slope, we found it blocked by snow several feet deep. A trading caravan on mules was stranded on the edge, its drivers uncertain what next to attempt. There could not be any question about returning to the southern side of the pass; we had to find a path down the snow covered slope. After a brief consultation it was decided to unload the mules and send them down to find a suitable trail for the rest of the caravan. The hardy animals acquitted themselves of their task splendidly. Belly-deep in snow, they descended the steep slope and reached the narrow gorge at the foot of the pass. They were followed by our loaded caravan animals and ourselves. The air resounded with cries of "*Hash, hosh!*" and "*Kabhardah, Kabhar-dah!*" Horses stumbled, men crept behind them, holding on to the tails of the animals. Sometimes the moving column would send a huge block of snow down the slope. When we reached the foot of the pass and looked up, we saw the whole mountain side covered by a dark crawling string of pack animals and men. We were fortunate not to lose any of our animals or men during this dangerous crossing. Pre-occupied with the difficulties of the trail, we had no time to admire the severe mountain panorama that opened before us. Dark, almost black, jagged peaks, rimmed with sparkling snow, stood out in sharp contrast to the dismal gray sky. The wind was raging in the gorge at the foot of the pass, dispersing the snow in fantastic designs on the mountain slopes. “By the grace of God, we came down,” shouted our Moslem caravan drivers, when we had reached the stony bottom.

Soon complete darkness enveloped the weathered rocks of the gorge. Nazar Bai rode ahead in search of a suitable grazinjg ground for the night, and his broad-shouldered figure mounted on his swift raven steed disappeared into the darkness. We continued marching until a very late hom. The men were murmuring and the animals were tired after the fatiguing struggle across the pass. My watch showed nine o’clock, then ten o’clock. Still no traces of Nazar Bai. The murmurs among the caravan drivers became louder. Was the old Nazar Bai mad to make men and animals march for more than twelve hours? It was getting impossible to ride because of the darkness. Myself and one of our syces went ahead of the caravan to find the trail. We went on foot, leading our horses behind us. Suddenly we found ourselves in water.

We had been inarching along the bank of a tiny mountain rivulet, which suddenly became a considerable stream and crossed our path. There was nothing to do but mount our tired horses and cross the stream. In the darkness ahead of us we heard shouts. It was Nazar Bai, who had found a camping ground. The tired caravan moved into the camp. Weary men quarreled among themselves, the Ladakis accusing the Turkis of dark intentions. This day we had spent fourteen hours on horseback.

October 3. We started somewhat later than usual. Our pack animals had wandered far down the stream in the night and had to be brought back.

The trail led down a sandrock gorge into a vast broad plain in which the Chinese outpost of Suget Karaul was situated. Northward rose a high snowy range — a western branch of the K’un-lun. On the northwest a broad gorge leading into the mountains left a passage open toward the Sanju Pass. It was refreshing to see shrubs along the banks of the stream. Numerous ducks and snipes along the banks were the first signs of animal life after sixteen days of barren country. The region has a scant population of Kirghiz whose chief occupation is cattle breeding. Agriculture is said to exist along the foot of the snowy range north of the valley. The only agricultural produce is barley, which seldom ripens and is mostly used as straw for caravan animals. After two hours’ march, we were in view of the mud-built Chinese fort, a square courtyard sinrounded by several brick hovels. A figure appeared outside the gates and rushed back inside the fort. We were apparently noticed. Our Chinese interpreter hmried ahead to announce our arrival.

The officer commanding the fort gave us a very hearty reception. His staff consisted of a Turki interpreter and some twenty militia, mobilized from among the local Kirghiz. During our visit to the fort, the personnel of the fort garrison was absent in the mountains and the population of the fort consisted of the Chinese frontier officer, the interpreter and his wife. Besides us, another Yarkendi caravan was camping in the fort courtyard. After the usual formalities were over and our passports had been examined, the frontier officer dispatched a rider to Sanju and farther to Guma, announcing our arrival and ordering the local population along the route to keep everything ready for our coming. We decided to stay but one day at the fort and to continue the journey the following day. Late into the night large camp fires illumined the fort walls and burly figures of men were squatting round them.

48 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

telling each other fresh news from Yarkend, Leh, and Kashmir. Here was the true Asia of the caravans, in which even the most prosaic news assumes the shape of heroic legends, that are told and retold along the great trade routes.

October 4. It is always difficult to tear people away from resting places. We started only in the afternoon, for our march to Shahidullah was to be a very short one. We were accompanied by two Kirghiz “soldiers” who had orders to look after our comfort on the journey. Both of them rode their horses bareback and indulged in all sorts of equestrian exercises.

Having crossed the broad plain in the direction of the gorge, we reached the Karakash darya, the Black Nephrite River, one of the rivers that feed the rich oases of Khotan. We camped there after two hours’ march. The grazing was exceptionally good and our horses had a long-deserved rest.

Behind the camp the ruins of a former Chinese frontier post and the mazar or tomb of a Mohammedan saint rose on a steep crag. Many of these mazars were built on spots formerly occupied by Buddhist stupas. October 5. We continued our journey down the Karakash Valley. The road was stony and heavy, in places very narrow. Sandstone cliffs overhung it and at several points the spring and summer floods had washed away the trail, which forded the river at least fourteen times during the day’s march. On our way we passed the first relay station, a mud hut with bundles of hay on its roof. The station was in charge of a Kirghiz family. Women in high white headdresses and long chapans or coats, stood by the roadside. Not far from the station, Nazar Bai’s pack ponies, shied at something and stampeded, throwing off their loads. Two of them broke their front legs on the stony trail. This delayed us considerably and it was late in the afternoon when we reached the next relay station and camped outside its walls. It was pathetic to see the two horses with fractured legs, limping behind the caravan. We persuaded Nazar Bai to leave them with the local Kirghiz, who arc very skilful in treating horses and curing fractures.

The country was becoming much more populated. Besides parties of pilgrims to Mecca, hurrying southward before the snow might block the passes, small groups of Kirghiz men and women were seen moving about the valley. Terraced fields of barley lay on both banks of the river and our hungry animals received daily rations of hay. Toward the evening heavy dust clouds, that crept from behind the mountain ranges

49 FROM LEH TO KHOTAN 

to the north, appeared over the mountain crest and blew across the valley. We were approaching the great desert basin of inner Asia, and each breath of wind brought dust from its vast sandy expanses.

October 6. We continued our march down the Karakash River. The country suddenly became again more deserted and the rugged sandstone cliffs pressed on both sides of the river gorge. We passed a large Kirghiz cemetery — stately mazars of an unmistakably Iranian style of architecture, and ordinary stone tombs, in front of which stood long poles with black horse and yak tails attached to them, a characteristic feature of Mohammedan tombs in Chinese Turkestan.

On our seventh mile, we came across numerous caves cut in the mountain side. They were said to be used by the local Kirghiz as winter quarters and storerooms. They strikingly resembled the Buddhist cave monasteries of Chinese Turkestan.

A heavy stone trail led to the foot of the Sanju Pass. The river gorge narrowed considerably, the trail running along the river for some dis- tance and then turning into a side valley. At the head of this valley lay a small inclosed spot covered by colossal bowlders and detritus — the foot of the Sanju Pass. We pitched our tents as best we could, but had to spend the night head downward. In the evening a storm brought a light, wet snow on the pass^ which drifted about our tents. The yaks which had to carry our baggage across the pass arrived late at night and their black mass almost smashed our camp. Their Kirghiz drivers were unaware of its exact situation, and drove the herd of pack yaks straight into it, tearing tent ropes and tents. We all had to protect our tents from the advancing beasts which, frightened, dashed through the camp and had to be caught on the mountain side.

October 7. The empty pack horses left the camp before dawn, in or- der to cross the pass before the yak caravan. They were followed by our party, which also rode on yaks. The ascent to the pass was very steep and in several places the trail was covered by a thin crust of slippery ice. The trail went by a zigzag route. In winter the pass must be ter- rible, for snow and stone avalanches sweep down its steep, jagged slope. It took fully three hours to reach the summit. The trail passed amid sharp rocky crags, and at the very summit there was a broad and deep crevasse, over which the animals had to jump. At this place, one of our followers fell from his yak and bruised his leg.

The descent was gradual and led into a broad valley girded by grass- covered rolling hills. This was a typical nomad highland, here and

50 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

there covered by Kirghiz qishlaq or winter quarters. We were now accompanied by the local Kirghiz headman, a brave looking man of about forty, with his match-lock and large fur cap. We continued our journey along the mountain rivulet and soon came across a large Kirghiz encampment. The white and light gray felt tents of the Kirghiz looked very inviting and a large crowd of people awaited our arrival. We camped outside the ail and wandered about the tents of the nomads. They were extremely friendly and offered us juicy melons — the first melons that we had seen for years. The women and children were neatly dressed, and the interiors of the felt tents were artfully decorated with carpets and embroidery. Some had large, profusely decorated coffers brought from Andijan. The well-being of the local nomads struck us at once. The Sanju Kirghiz seemed to be much supe- rior to their brothers of the Mongolian Altai and the mountain regions of Jungaria.

The mountain side was alive with cattle and horsemen who came and went, carrying the news of the arrival of strangers. Kirghiz women collected round Mrs. Roerich and wondered at her costume. It was a kindly crowd and the high white headdresses shook in amazement at the camping outfit of the expedition. The local Kirghiz breed mostly yaks and sheep; horses are raised only in insignificant numbers, and camels are only rarely met with. All the camels which we saw grazing on the mountain slopes belonged to wealthy Yarkend or Khotan traders.

October 8. The trail followed a stream, the Sanju-su according to its local name. It crossed the river several times and was used only in winter or late autumn. In summer, when the river is flooded and carries a considerable volume of water, another route is used, which follows the crest of the ridge west of the river valley, crossing a low pass and necessitating much climbing. The route along the valley was easy and led in a gradual descent to the Oasis of Sanju.

On our way we met several camel caravans slowly moving up the trail on their hard and long journey into the heart of the mountains. After six hours’ march along the dusty trail, we camped close to a lonely tent of a Kirghiz family. The owner brought us some milk and raisins and tried to do what he could to assist us. Willow bushes grew along the banks and a large drove of horses wandered on the green patches of grass at the foot of the hills. To the north a dusty haze hid the plains of Turkestan, the country of the “six cities” or Altyn-shahr.

51 FROM LEH TO KHOTAN 

The local Kirghiz population was under the jurisdiction of the dis- trict officer of Guma. A customs official to supervise the trade along the Sanju route was stationed at Sanju Bazaar, the most populated point of the Sanju Oasis. These were the only Chinese officials in the district and all important matters were usually referred to the district officer at Gvima, who was subordinate to the Governor or Tao-yin of Khotan, a post created only recently.

The two Kirghiz who accompanied us proved to be quite decent fel- lows who tried their best to procure fuel and fodder for the caravan. We questioned local inhabitants about possible old ruined sites or l{pne- shahr in the vicinity of the mountains, caves or ancient tombs or mazars. All of us had heard about the ruined cities of the Taklamakan and the rich finds of Sir Aurel Stein around Khotan and east of this oasis. Nothing was known to exist in the mountains north of the Sanju Pass and the only antiquities were Chinese copper coins imported from down country.

October 9. On the ninth of October we reached the first village of the Sanju Oasis and with it the desert country of Turkestan. The river gorge widened and the high rugged mountains on either side of it be- came low undulating hills that stretched far to the north. The open northern horizon was screened by the everlasting dust haze. We turned southward toward the jagged peaks and bade a last farewell to the kingdom of mountains. There they stood, sparkling snows and dark rock masses enveloped by the same dusty veil.

With the approach to the oasis, it became decidedly hotter, and our sturdy Ladakis threw off their heavy sheepskins to the waist. As if sens- ing an oasis ahead, men and animals moved hurriedly along the dusty loess-covered trail. Suddenly in the distance something dark showed — hazy spots that appeared and disappeared in the trembling air of the desert. Were they trees or bushes } Our Ladakis, who marched ahead of us, shouted loudly “Ja-pa, ja-pa!" “Poplars, poplars!” They were indeed poplars, a whole grove of them at the roadside.

Before reaching the grove, we passed a huge bowlder. Curious graffiti on its surface attracted our attention. To our great surprise, we saw represented on the stone, ibexes, bowmen, and circles of dancing men — the same figures as appear on stones from Khalatse and other places of western Tibet. Dr. A. H. Francke has demonstrated their ritual use and connection with the ancient primitive nature worship of Tibet. It is difficult to estimate the precise date of these graffiti, for they are made

52 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

even nowadays. They seem to be fairly widely spread all over western Tibet and the neighboring mountain regions — ^perhaps the work of passing caravans or the ruins of a remote antiquity. The surface of the stone was weathered and the drawings seemed to be old. The Ladakis knew nothing of this particular stone; although many of them had traveled by this route before, they had never noticed it previously. They told us that similar stones with graffiti were fovind throughout Tibet. It is interesting to note that the ibexes were venerated by the ancient Mongols and played a prominent part in their fire cult.* These stones, scattered throughout inner Asia, seem to be remnants of a remote an- tiquity, dating back to a shamanistic form of worship which was uni- versal in the higher regions of Asia.

We were about to halt, when we noticed several horsemen galloping toward us. They proved to be Sanju headmen and a darogha or yoryeh, a messenger sent by the magistrate of Guma. They all dismounted and, striking their beards in the approved fashion of Turkestan, congratu- lated us on our successful arrival. They begged us to ride up to the next poplar grove, where they prepared a dastarXftan or feast for us. On finely designed ntmdah or felts, quantities of fruit and other food were spread — all that the country produced. From afar the fruits seemed like a nature morte painted by some French Impressionist. Heaps of melons and apricots, juicy pears, red and blue tinted eggs, roast chicken, and mutton. Turkestan bread, and tea were also ready. We were obliged, according to custom, to partake of the food, and the grave headmen, in their dark blue and green chapans, formed a semicircle before us. The darogha handed us the large red visiting card of the Guma amhan. His master had ordered him to accompany the expedition to Khotan and to see that We should be properly received by all local authorities along the southern caravan route. This darogha was a soldier of the local garrison, a Turki by nationality, with the old-fashioned uniform of the Chinese imperial troops — a broad black blouse with huge red characters: on his chest *'Hsin-chiang seng” or the “New Dominion,” and on the back, “Guma.”

After an hour’s halt, we continued our march down the gradually sloping valley. Poplar and apricot groves were ever5rwhere. Barley and cornfields covered the open plains. Numerous irrigation ditches car- ried the water to the fields, and the whole landscape presented a scene of a thriving agricultural oasis. The first village was situated in a heavy

53 FROM LEH TO KHOTAN

grove of poplars, willows, and fruit trees. A neat and gaily dressed crowd of women and men awaited our arrival. A large and shady bagh or garden was reserved for our camp. We pitched our tents under the shady trees, and for the first time in several weeks walked over soft, grassy soil. An inquisitive crowd of villagers moved about the tents, but with dignity, and no one ventured to look inside. We presented the friendly headman with a wrist watch and the old man beamed with satisfaction. He at once reciprocated by sending us huge watermelons, peaches, and pears.

October 10. Next morning we marched off, across a thickly populated country. The river flowed in several channels that had cut broad and deep courses in the soft loess of the country. Along these water channels was a dense population and cultivated Helds and orchards. Above the river were low hilly spurs that stretched into the immensity of the desert region, north of the oasis.

On the ride through the shady villages we were much impressed by the relative well-being of the population. There were neither Chinese officials nor tradesmen in the roadside hamlets. Outside the hospitable village, another dastarkhhan awaited us. This time it was offered by the former Andijan aqsaqal or elder, who had lost his post on account of political changes in his native country. His peaches were luscious and we thoroughly enjoyed the coolness of his garden house. The owner himself was a tall man, cleanly dressed and of quiet, pleasing manner. He told us that the Roosevelt Expedition had passed this way en route for Yarkend and Kashgar. A cavalcade of begs and headmen accompanied us on our way for a considerable stretch. Our horses, after yesterday’s feast on fresh lucern and grain, had completely changed their mood and pranced on the sandy road, raising clouds of suffocating dust. A ride of several hours brought us to the large bazaar of Sanju. This place is a large village with several Chinese shops, in which sit the pale sons of the great Far Eastern country. The heat was very oppressive and the bazaar streets were canopied with mats, that prevented the sun rays from penetrating inside and darkened the streets.

A dastarkan was offered on a square level place in the very heart of the settlement. We would have preferred a garden outside the village but had to accept the offered accommodations. A loud jingling of bells announced the arrival of the local Chinese custom official — a pale yovmg man in a blue silken coat and black skullcap. He dismounted from a prancing iron-gray steed, seated himself in front of our tents

54 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

and chatted for a considerable time, while he continuously smoked cigarettes. Our Chinese interpreter, true to the old traditions of imperial China, considering him ill-mannered, whispered to me “Look at his manners!” The officer inquired about our journey and strongly advised us to go to Kashgar first. The Tao-^ai of Kashgar, he said, was a pleasant man with wide experience in European matters; Khotan was indeed a wonderful place, but the new Governor Ma was a troublesome man whom it was better to avoid.

We fully appreciated the advice of this friendly young man only after our conflict with the universally feared Ma Shao-wu of Khotan. The official invited us for a dinner at his yamen and took his leave. Professor Roerich and Mrs. Roerich preferred the quiet of our camp and I had to go alone with our interpreter, Mr. Ts’ai. The distance was a very short one but our interpreter insisted that we should ride. And so we rode at good speed the five hundred yards that separated our camp from the poor yamen. Such is etiquette! At the dinner I questioned the official about possible ruined cities in the vicinity of Sanju. According to him, all relics had been taken by European explorers and for several years nothing had appeared on the market. We might find some clay images at Zanguya, our next stage, but nothing substantial. The profession of Tal(lamanchis or treasure seekers in the sands of the Taklamakan Desert was becoming rare and only few people continued to occupy themselves with excavations in its sandy dunes. The official related the story of Dr. Le Coq’s explorations at Kashgar, where his assistant penetrated the cave temple of Utsh-Murghan on a rope. Stories about European explorers are a common topic of conversation at dinner parties. It was getting late and we hurried back to our camp to make preparations for tomorrow’s journey.

October 11. Soon after leaving the Sanju Bazaar we ascended a vast plateau and before us opened the wide gravel expanse of the southern border of the Taklamakan — ^boundless and burning hot. A well-beaten track, trodden by thousands of caravan animals, led northeast. The plain seemed absolutely deserted except for a lonely horseman who suddenly appeared in the distance. He dismounted, fettered his horse, and spread on the burning sand of the desert a white felt and some melons. He proved to be a poor traveler, who thought it to be his duty to welcome travelers from foreign lands. We alighted from our horses and partook of his melons — z pleasant refreshment in the burning heat

of midday. In return we presented our unknown host with a hunting knife.

We rode for the whole afternoon across sandy and gravel plains. A faint dusty outline of low barren hills to the south, indicated the great mountain system of the K’un-lun. At sunset, we reached the dusty, filthy village of Zanguya. The vicinity of the great caravan highway was at once noticeable. Gone were the neat village hovels of upper Sanju and the clean dresses of its inhabitants. Everything was dusty at Zanguya and the population seemed to be poor and scornful. A dastarkhan was offered to us and we pitched our camp in a dusty fruit garden. Omar Khan’s horses were in such bad state, that their owner had to hire camels to carry our baggage to Khotan.

October 12. The morning was a very hot one and the long and trying march to Pialma was ahead of us. Former travelers have written much about the fatigues of the desert journey to the ancient Kingdom of Jade. On our way we were joined by a Chinese captain journeying on leave to distant Lan-chou in Kansu. He was accompanied by only one servant and his baggage was packed in huge saddlebags — ^always a great nuisance in caravans, for they cause terrible sores on the horses and yaks. The captain talked on different topics: of the walled-up library of Tun-huang, of fabulous palaces near Aksu, of General Anenkov and his Cossacks, and of Tibetan tribes near Sining-fu. Tired of conversation we kept silent and our new acquaintance started to sing some Chinese ballads. But what songs! Shrill, incongruous soiuids, wild exclamations filled the air of the desert. Horses snorted, and my gray tried persistently to get away from the howling rider. I have heard Chinese songs and even learned to appreciate some of the religious tunes of old China, but such a song was a merciless parody on the musical art of the country. Even Ts’ai, the Chinese interpreter, shook his head and seemed depressed. He afterward admitted that the singing captain disgusted him.

We marched for ten hours and the burning sun shone pitilessly on the desert road. Late in. the evening we entered the large oasis and village of Pialma and camped in a garden reserved for our use.

Early in the morning of October 13 we left Pialma for Zawa Kurghan. The road from Pialma to Zawa was a very heavy one and led over belts of sand dimes. For the first two hours after leaving Pialma, the road led over a vast gravel plain, and in the clear air of the early dawn the snowy peaks of the K’un-lun were clearly visible. After this

56 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

brief stretch of firm road, sand dunes appeared on either side of the trail and the road became difficult and tiresome for both men and caravan animals.

We passed on the route several families of Chinese soldiers traveling to Yarkend. The men were on foot with huge packs on their backs, the women and children on small donkeys.

Before Zawa Kurghan we came upon patches of weathered grass and traces of cultivation. While crossing the numerous dune belts, we suddenly noticed doves flying eastward. A two-mile march brought us to a wonderful mazar or sanctuary on the Khotan road, known as Kaptar-Mazar or the “Pigeon’s Sanctuary.” Thousands of pigeons live in wooden hovels situated inside an inclosed courtyard. All of them are said to be the offspring of a pair of doves which miraculously appeared from the heart of Imam Shahid Padshah, who died here in a battle. These pigeons are said to guide lost travelers in the desert to a considerable distance beyond the mazar. An old man served as attendant to the pigeons and we bought from him several pounds of grain to give to them — this is a pious act performed by all travelers along the Khotan route.*

Zawa Kurghan is, strictly speaking, the westernmost village of the Khotan Oasis. We camped in a small garden situated behind a serai for travelers. At this stage, we had the great misfortune to lose our faithful Kong-po dog, Amdong. He perished from the heat in the burning desert and the Ladaki servant brought in only a lifeless body.

October 14. The road from Zawa to Khotan goes alongside arable land. Everywhere are seen villages, farmsteads, and mazars. We passed several bazaars with Chinese gates, surmounted by Chinese inscriptions eulogizing the work of former city magistrates of Khotan. Dusty lanes of poplars led to the town itself. We rode through the gate of the Chinese city or Han-ch’eng, and at once our small party was surrounded by a dense crowd of Chinese soldiers and traders, who ran after our horses crying and shouting. Soldiers with red and yellow shoulder straps were everywhere, and we were greatly surprised to find such a number of them in the bazaars, but the Ma Ta-jen was said to be a great admirer of the martial art.

A petty official from the yamen of the Governor met us on the way and led into a dusty garden with Chinese pavilions, which once belonged to a former city magistrate who had collected a big fortune dur-

1. Stein, Sand'buried Ruins of Khotan, pp. 179 ff.

57 FROM LEH TO KHOTAN

ing his tenure of office. The place was small and dusty, and was, moreover, situated in the very center of the evil-smelling Chinese city. We expressed our desire to camp in another place and were at once conducted to the clean garden of Badruddin Khan, the Afghan aqsaqal of the Indian traders and an old friend and helper of Sir Aurel Stein. The old aqsaqal and his numerous family had chairs and tea arranged for us, and we were glad to meet people who could tell us something about the antiquities of Khotan and new sites discovered in its neighborhood. Badruddin Khan had a small collection of antiquities at his home and he promised to show it to us some day.

We camped in the garden, but a dense crowd of some three hundred Chinese and Turkis hindered the pitching of the tents. Everyone came to see our Tibetan mastiff, Tumbal. In order to bring the dog alive across the burning desert, we had him chained in a dandy, and four of our Ladakis carried the dog to the town. The entry of the black animal into the Khotan bazaar, sitting erect in his dandy, created a tremendous uproar among the bazaar population. Women screamed and shops were closed. Everyone was certain that the foreigners had brought with them a large black bear. The Governor even sent his private secretary with his visiting card to inquire about the animal. A huge crowd pressed from every side and neither our pack horses with baggage nor our men could enter the compound. I accordingly sent our ya-yeh to the officer conunanding the Khotan garrison to send two or three soldiers to keep the crowd away from the garden. These duly appeared, armed with old Mauser rifles, but their efforts proved vain. The crowd doubled in number and new contingents of infantry soldiers were pouring in through the narrow gate of the garden wall. Our young Ladaki bashi suddenly got the brilliant idea of shouting loudly, “The dog has broken its chain!” This had a magical effect. The crowd leftrthe compound in a wild stampede. In an instant everyone was gone, even the secretary of the Governor, although we wished him to stay. We tried to get hold of the two soldiers who were sent by the officer commanding the garrison Khotan but the men had fled with the crowd and had left their rifles standing at the garden gate.

We had to post two of our Ladakis in order to prevent a further intrusion. Our first night in Khotan was by no means pleasant. The air was sticky, and the smells that permeated the city added greatly to its discomforts.

KHOTAN

IT was difficult to realize that we had reached Khotan, the ancient Kingdom of Jade, and one of the most thriving oases of the Chinese Province of Hsin-chiang. The modern city with its covered bazaars and dusty lanes, hides the visage of ancient Khotan, once an important seat of Buddhist learning and emporium of central Asian trade.

In the oldest Chinese Annals, the town is known by the name of Yu-t’ien. The native name was Kustana, or Ch’iu-sa-tan-na in the Chinese transcription (another transcription is Ch’iu-tan).

Sir Aurel Stein, during his several archaeological expeditions in Khotan and its vicinity, has discovered a mass of tablets inscribed in Kharoshthi, an Indian alphabet current in the northwest of India about the beginning of our era. These documents give us valuable insight into the everyday life of the great trading oases along the southern caravan route, connecting Khotan with distant Tun-huang and the interior of China.

During the pre-Mohammedan period of central Asian history, Khotan was inhabited by an Iranian population, which spoke an Iranian dialect conditionally designated by the name of Oriental-Iranian.

The ancient city of Khotan and the other important oases along the trade route, had large colonies of Indian merchants, carrying on a considerable trade with northwestern India. It was probably these Indian colonies that introduced the Kharoshthi alphabet. The population of Khotan was Buddhist, professing the Mahayana form. Chinese pilgrims, who braved the dangers of the central Asian deserts in quest of knowledge from India, have left us detailed accounts of the thriving state of Buddhism in the Kingdom of Khotan and the wonderful religious zeal of its monarchs.

There is little to glean from Mohammedan sources about the medieval history of Khotan. It seems to have remained Buddhist even after the Mohammedan conquest of about looo a.d. The Mohammedan author, Gardizi, says that the people of Khotan were Buddhist but he also mentions a Mohammedan cemetery, north of Khotan, and two Chris-

62 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

tian churches in the town itself (neither Christian nor Manichean relics have so far been discovered in Khotan).

Ibn-al Athir mentions Kadir Khan Yusuf, who died in 1032 a.d., as the Mohammedan conqueror of Khotan.

During the period from the tenth century to the twelfth century a.d. Khotan was conquered by the Ilek-khans and the Kara-Khitai. From the thirteenth century the ancient kingdom owed allegiance to China and continued a semi-independent existence, under the overlordship of China, until the eighteenth century, when it formed part of the State of the Khodjas (saints). The Khodjas were followed by the Jungar Mongols, who held Khotan until 1758 a.d. when the Oi’rat power crumbled under the decisive blows delivered by the Chinese imperial troops. From that date, Khotan remained under Chinese control except for a brief period beginning in 1863-64 when the oasis was invaded by Yakub Beg. After his violent death in 1877 a.d. Khotan again accepted Chinese sovereignty and has remained ever since under the overlordship of China. Such are the outstanding historical facts in the life of the famous oasis.

The ruins of the pre-Mohammedan town lie some five miles west of the modern town. Sir Aurel Stein has gathered on its site important collections of small antiquities and coins. The insurmountable obstacle to systematic archaeological excavations lies in the fact that the ancient city is partly re-covered by a modern settlement and some Mohammedan cemeteries, which it is impossible to disturb.

From time to time landslides uncover terra cotta figurines and masses of ancient coins, which usually fall into the hands of local treasureseekers. For the past few years the archaeological spoils have been very insignificant. The local people had quickly learned to imitate terra cotta figurines of stupas and even animals, and the Khotan market displays a good number of these spurious antiques. The profession of treasure-seekers has almost disappeared and very few people care to visit the desert tracts.

Some of the local notables, aware of the value of genuine antiques, accumulate for themselves considerable collections of smaller objects with an ultimate view of selling them to wealthy foreigners. In such cases the prices are usually very high and the story is told that the collection has been registered by the Indian Archaeological Department. During our stay in Khotan, the veteran Indian aqsaqcd, Badruddin Khan, once the local agent of Sir Aurel Stein, showed us a considerable

63 KHOTAN

collection of antiquities, gathered by him and his agents at Yotkan, Rawak, Niya, Mazar Imam Jafar Sadik, and distant Miran, all places explored by Sir Aurel Stein. This collection comprised well-preserved stucco heads of Buddhas, jars with handles adorned with human and animal heads, fragments of frescoes, objects in clay, such as votive stupas, offering lamps, animal figures, etc. The collection included several wooden tablets inscribed in Kharoshthi, torn fragments of a text in Oriental-Iranian, lists of Tibetan writings on paper from the Miran site, containing mostly leave permits for soldiers of the Tibetan garrison in the Miran Fort. (A curious detail is the constant use of the word dpa^ for “soldier”; in the present-day language, the word has the restricted sense of “hero.”)

Badruddin Khan had also a large manuscript with leaves bound together, written in the central Asian slanting script, which was said to have come from some locality situated between Aksu and Kuchar.

The price he asked for the whole collection was exorbitant, and notwithstanding protracted negotiations we were unable to lower it. Our limited supply of silver and banknotes, the diflSculty of obtaining a new supply from the outside, and the subsequent difficulties with local authorities, forced us to drop the matter. I have heard since that the collection has been acquired by some foreign travelers who visited Khotan after our departure.

The modern oasis of Khotan has about 150,000 inhabitants, with a considerable Chinese colony of officials, their families, traders, and soldiers. The city consists of two parts, the Kone-shahr or the Old City occupied by the Mohammedan population, and the Yangi-shahr or New City, also called Han-ch’eng, the Walled Chinese City, built in 1883. Throughout its history, Khotan was an important trading center ' on the ancient silk route. The fame of Khotan artisans lives to the present day. Khotan silks, carpets, felts, wool, furs, and jade are still in great demand, and command good prices throughout central Asia, India, and distant China. Before the Revolution of 1917 considerable trade was conducted with Russia through Irkeshtam.

Khotan silk manufacture is the largest in the country, and Khotanese silk fabrics are found in all the markets of Chinese Turkestan and a few years ago were exported in considerable quantity to Russian Turkestan through Kashgar and the frontier outpost of irkeshtam. Besides silk fabrics, Khotan is noted for its cotton stuffs, which are exported in large quantities. The Khotanese silk and cotton factories are largely worked

64 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

by female and child labor. We knew of several big Khotan merchants who owned some two hundred girls and obliged them to work in their factories. A mild form of slavery is still a distinct feature of Khotanese life. Parents usually have nothing against their daughters or sons being sold to a family of good social standing, where they are well cared for. Many have become slaves through being unable to pay their debts. The usual price for a girl of fourteen is from fifteen to thirty Mexican dollars. A child of four is often sold for a couple of dollars. Mohammedan merchants pay regular visits to the Kansu Province, where they buy children under the age of five and transport them to Turkestan to be sold to families. During our crossing of the Kansu Province we once came across a party of boys and girls, all under five, sold to a wealthy Mohammedan merchant. They all were sitting in a courtyard, learning to recite Mohammedan prayers.

Besides silk and cotton stuffs, Khotan produces a large quantity of carpets. The old art of carpet weaving was lost long ago and the modern factories produce imitations of Chinese and old Persian carpets. Khotan carpets are found throughout central Asia. The Kirghiz and Torgut traders from Jungaria and Karashahr pay yearly visits to Khotan, and carry away a considerable portion of the yearly produce in carpets, which are used in furnishing felt tents and monasteries.

In recent years, Khotan felts have been in great demand. These felts are manufactured all along the southern trade route between Yarkend and Khotan, but the center of manufacture is undoubtedly Khotan. These felts are often vividly colored and have a striking design. Most of the trade is done with India, where the felts are in growing demand, not only for Indian markets, but also for foreign markets. Khotan sheepskins are valued throughout Chinese Turkestan and are commonly used as winter lining for coats and winter caps. The skins are well tanned and compare favorably with the other fur-producing centers of Turkestan, such as Kashgar, Aksu, and Kuchar.

The present jade manufacture is very insignificant. The trade received a rude shock during the rule of Ma Fu-hsin, the Ti-t'ai of Kashgar, who ordered the exportation of a number of skilled artisans from Khotan for his jade works in Kashgar.

As an agricultural center, Khotan occupies an important place. It is well watered and the fertile beds of alluvial loess afford ample opportunity for agriculture.*

I. For a detailed account of the physical aspects of the Khotan Oasis, see Sir Aurel Stein's Ancient Khotan, I, 124 ff.

65 KHOTAN

Wheat, corn, barley, and rice are cultivated on an extensive scale. The oasis boasts of many fruit orchards, where apples, pears, apricots, grapes, melons, etc., are grown.

The sight of modern Khotan is unattractive for one who is accustomed to the rich coloring of the mountain tracts. For hours one rides along dusty lanes, lined with poplars. On either side are half-ruined clay structures — ^farm houses, mazars or tombs, roadside mosques, or endless brick walls which fence off plots of waste land. The covered bazaars are evil smelling and only the exceptional dryness of the climate prevents epidemics. The bazaar streets are narrow and are always blocked by fruitstands and hawkers, who wander through the dense crowd. Most of the shops are open, and the goods are displayed on the stands. Many of the shops are run by women who trade in the name of their husbands.

During the crowded bazaar hours, it is almost impossible to ride through the crowds that swarm through the streets. Caravans on horses, mules, donkeys, and camels may block the way for hours, and unbelievable clamor and shouts rise when two caravans collide in the narrow market place. The native manner of getting through a crowd is to beat one’s way through, and this method is extensively used by the Chinese soldiery. Sometimes one hears a loud outcry and sees the crowd flee in all directions, overturning fruitstands. A moment later one sees a carriage approaching, preceded by several mounted soldiers who lash the throng with their long whips. It is surprising that no one takes objection to the treatment, accepting it as one of the prerogatives of official power.

By night the bazaars are lit with oil lamps and Chinese paper lanterns, making a very colorful picture.

As to the social life of Khotan, suffice it to say that the town and its populace has not changed since the time of Marco Polo. The account left by the great Venetian is still a true reproduction of Khotanese manners and customs.

Our sojourn in Khotan began with busy days. Visits had to be paid to the Tao-fai or Governor, the amban or city magistrate, and the tung-iing, officer commanding the Khotan garrison. We began our visits early in the morning of our first day in Khotan. First we went to the Tao-t’ai yamen. Professor Roerich and I rode on horseback, followed by our Chinese interpreter and preceded by several begs or headmen and Chinese soldiers, who cleared the way through the narrow streets

66 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

of the Mohammedan $ection of the city. As soon as we appeared, a crowd formed and followed us to the gates of the Governor’s residence. A detachment of infantry was lined up on either side of the large entrance gate. The men, in dark gray uniforms with red shoulder straps, presented arms. Then they rushed past us to the next gate, again lined up and again presented arms. This ceremony was performed three times at each of the three gates of the yamen. The Tao^fatmtt us in the inner courtyard of his residence.

Ma Shao-wu, the conqueror of Kashgar and the slayer of the was a diminutive man with aquiline features and polite, quiet manners. After the usual ceremonial inquiries about health, the road, etc., he begged us to enter a large room reserved for the occasion. Here tea was served on a small table, around which we took our seats, the subordinate officials remaining standing all the time.

The room was furnished in a strange and incongruous combination of Chinese and European style. In the corner stood the usual large Chinese bed, and small Chinese black tables were placed along the wall. The room was full of arms, the presence of which evinced the warlike habits of the Governor. On the walls hung German Mauser pistols in wooden holsters, and Russian Cossack swords. One of the corners of the room was occupied by innumerable wrist watches, a imique collection gathered by the Governor from Russian refugees, when he was the officer commanding the garrison at Uch-Turfan, a city on the Russian Turkestan border.

Behind each of us stood an armed guardsman of the Governor’s bodyguard; each man was armed with a sword, a pair of Mauser pistols, and heavy cartridge belts. An inquisitive crowd of Turki headmen and sectetaries pressed in the doorway. The Governor delivered a brief speech of welcome, telling us how glad he was to honor such distinguished foreigners. He hoped that we would make a prolonged stay in Khotan and rest after all the hardships of the snowy route over the Karakorum. He was ready to grant us every assistance and was himself deeply interested in the past of Khotan. He had heard about the splendid work achieved by Sir Aurel Stein in this very region and it was his wish to assist scholars from foreign lands in their explorations. During this brief address, couched in such friendly and enlightened terms, I had time to examine the person of the Governor and recall to my mind the recent events of his troubled life.

Ma Shao-wu belonged to a great and distinguished family of Chinese

TUMBAL, THE TIBETAN MASTIFF MA SHAO-WU, GOVERNOR OF KHOTAN

OF THE EXPEDITION

MILITARY GOVERNOR OF KASHGAR

KHOTAN

Mohammedans. His father was once the Viceroy of the Yunnan Province and lost his life in a rebellion against the imperial throne of China. The present Governor of Khotan spent his younger days in distant Yunnan, then was exiled to the torrid desert tracts of western Kansu and Hsin-chiang. This family had produced several outstanding personalities, all of them occupying important posts in Chinese Provincial administration.

Ma Fu-hsin, the murdered Ti-^ai of Kashgar, was one of them and the strong man of Sining, General Ma, belongs to the same line. For many years the present Governor of Khotan was the officer commanding the garrison of Kashgar and Uch-Turfan. It is during this period that a deep-rooted animosity was shown between him and his elder relative, the Ti-fai of Kashgar.

Ma Ti-t’ai was a characteristic figure in the Chinese administration of the New Dominion. He was a ruthless despot, who knew no mercy for either Chinese or native Turki. He built himself a huge palace in the Chinese town or Han-ch’eng of Kashgar, and had several summer houses in its vicinity. He constructed bridges and roads and planted trees along them. A native daring to hit a tree with his carriage would have the fingers of both hands cut off. The Tt-fai owned large enterprises outside the city, was interested in oil, and maintained a large jade factory for which he requisitioned the best artisans from Khotan. He had a pitiless way of removing his competitors in commercial enterprises. The unfortunate men were summoned to the Governor’s palace, and there were put to death or had their hands cut off. Now many of these unfortunate wretches are dead, but some are still begging in the bazaars of Kashgar, evidence of a cruel despot.

The Ti-t’cd was famous for his harem of some fifty wives. Any pretty peasant girl was in constant danger of being snatched away from her family and taken to the palace of the Governor. When tired of his wives, he iised to present them to his friends and officers who had distinguished themselves in service. He was known for his lavish entertainments and for a special brand of strong Chinese brandy, which he served at his dinner parties.

For several years before his fall in 1924, he cherished hopes of becoming the independent ruler of Kashgaria and his relations with Yang Tseng-hsin, Governor-General of the Hsin-chiang Province, were very strained.

In 1924 the war clouds began to gather. It was rumored that the

68 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

Ti-t’ai was planning a rebellion against the Governor-General of the Province and the Provincial Government realized the necessity of putting a stop to the dangerous activities of the Kashgar war lord. A large force of some 18,000 cavalry and infantry was mustered in Urumchi and the command was intrusted to Erh Tao-yin of Aksu, one of the ablest regional governors of Hsin-chiang. The force started on its march to Kashgar in February, 1924. One should not, however, think that all the 18,000 men were actually in the field. This large number of troops no doubt existed only on paper and the force that arrived in Kashgar amounted to only about five hundred men. In Hsin-chiang the authorities have a curious way of counting their troops. They are not counted by sabers or bayonets, but by their caps — not so many sabers or bayonets, but so many caps. Many of the regiment commanders have their soldiers only on paper. They have no soldiers, but keep caps for them and the caps are counted in official reports.

Ma Shao-wu, who was the officer commanding the garrison in Uch-Turfan, petitioned the Governor-General to be permitted to participate in the war expedition. In a spectacular dash, he covered the long stretch from Uch-Turfan to Urumchi, the capital of the Province, in seven days. His request was granted and he hurried back to take command of the vanguard of the expeditionary forces. By detour routes in the hills, the vanguard under Ma Shao-wu approached the Chinese city of Kashgar on June i, 1924, and swept through it. The soldiers of the Ti-t’ai were unprepared for an attack and offered but little resistance. The Han-ch’eng was soon occupied by the invaders, who stormed the palace of the Governor. The Ti-t’ai*s son, who occupied the post of Hsieh-fai, fought valiantly and fell dead in the courtyard of his citadel.

His father, the aged Ti-t’ai, is said to have offered firm resistance but was eventually overpowered and arrested in one of his private rooms. During the fighting his right arm was shot through by a bullet. The prisoner was led outside the main gate of the citadel, and there crucified on a wooden cross.

Ma Shao-wu personally commanded the firing squad. Eyewitnesses tell that before the execution the victorious Ma Shao-wu approached the crucified Ti-t’ai and shouted to him: “Do you recognize me, Ma Fu-hsin?” “Ma Shao-wu,” groaned the wounded Ti-t’ai. After this very brief dialogue, Ma Shao-wu fired his pistol at the Ti-t’ai, and the blood from the wound is said to have spurted on his coat — a bad sign, according to the Chinese. In the excitement the soldiers of the firing squad

shot at the Tufai without previous orders and almost killed Ma Shao-wu, who stood between them and the wounded man. He had a narrow escape.

For several days the corpse was exposed to the angry populace who came in thousands to avenge themselves. They spat in the face of the dead man, tore his beard, and threw refuse and stones. After this the body disappeared and its fate is unknown.

Ma Shao-wu remained master of the city, and foreign residents say that he acquitted himself well of the task and by a scries of stern measures restored order and prevented looting. It was apparently a coveted desire of Ma Shao-wu to remain in Kashgar in place of the slain Ti-t* at, but the Governor-General of the Province was well aware of the danger presented by the successful officer and resolved to appoint him to a more remote section. A separate governorship was accordingly created in Khotan, and Ma Shao-wu was appointed Tao-yin of the new district, which stretched from Karghalik to distant Tun-huang on the Kansu border.

Erh Tao-yin and his corps of 18,000 men never reached Kashgar and great hostility is said to exist between him and Ma Shao-wu.

During our stay in Khotan, it was commonly said that Ma Shao-wu had received orders from the Governor-General to send back his troops to Urumchi, but that the newly appointed Governor of Khotan disregarded the Governor-General’s orders and kept the troops in Khotan. This explained the presence of the great number of troops there.

Such was the great deed of Ma Shao-wu, for which he became famous throughout the vast Province. It was a family feud of long standing and the last act of the drama is still to be enacted. All during our stay in Khotan, the Tao-t’ at was apprehensive of an advance by General Ma of Sining to avenge the death of his cousin. Troops were said to have been concentrated at Tun-huang and rumors were whispered that General Ma was negotiating with the Provincial Government at Lanchou for a general advance on Hsin-chiang.

Such was the background of Ma Shao-wu when we first met him in Khotan. A man of considerable ability and personal courage, but an intriguer and revengeful, he found himself relegated to a distant province separated from the other inhabited places of Hsin<hiang by vast tracts of desert.

Our first meeting with the man was very friendly and we had all the prospects of a successful stay in Khotan. We took leave of the Governor

70 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

and proceeded to the city magistrate — a typical Chinese official of the interior of China. A faithful instrument of the Governor, he echoed the same readiness to assist us. The tung-ling or officer commanding the garrison at Khotan, whom we visited next, was a young man of pleasant manners and during our subsequent troubles occupied a neutral position. Everywhere we were met with the same ceremonies and guards of honor.

After a strenuous morning we returned to our camp. In the afternoon we received the visit of Ma Tao-t’ai, who was followed by the chih-shih or magistrate and the tung-ling. The Governor arrived in a covered carriage painted green on the outside and lined with violet velvet, drawn by three horses. The cortege was followed by forty cavalrymen of the Governor’s bodyguard on raven black horses. The bodyguard of forty men is said to be maintained by the Tao-t’ai at his own expense. All of the men were heavily armed and presented the pick of Chinese troops in Hsin-chiang. The Governor once more assured us of his good will and urged us to make ourselves comfortable in Khotan.

It was impossible to stay in the small garden of Badruddin Khan with our big caravan, and we therefore decided to find a suitable house with plenty of ground in which to establish our headquarters. In our search we encountered the first obstacle to be set in our way by the local authorities. We were fortunate in finding a beautifully situated summer house belonging to the late Afghan aqsaqal of Khotan, an ideal place for our headquarters, with extensive grounds, situated three miles from the city itself. We at once decided to rent the house and there establish the expedition headquarters. It was Persian in style and had stood empty since the death of its owner, as his widow lived in her town house. We made known our decision to a native interpreter, Kerim Beg, who was attached to our camp by the local authorities. He seemed very displeased at our choice, and hinted that the Governor would prefer to see us living closer to his residence. We thought it very strange and sent our Chinese secretary, Ts’ai, to the Governor’s yamen to inquire. He soon came back and reported that the Governor had assured him that he had nothing against our living in the summer house of the former Afghan aqsaqal and that the beg had misconstrued his orders. We accordingly instructed Kerim Beg to call on the aqsaqal family to discuss terms. He refused to do so, saying that the family was a very difficult one to deal with.

After this conversation, several days elapsed without our being able

71 KHOTAN

to settle the matter. It was during this period that we made the acquaintance of a local trader, KJiudai Berdi Bai, who became a trusted friend all through the period of our difficulties with local authorities. The matter of renting the house seemed to take a hopeless turn and we decided to negotiate directly with the Afghan aqsaqal’s family. To our great surprise, we found them very eager to rent the house. Someone was trying to prevent us from establishing our headquarters there. Who this dark shadow was, whose hand we found in all our difficulties in Khotan, we were xmable to ascertain. We signed an agreement, paid a month’s rent, and took possession of the house and compound, to the great consternation of Kerim Beg.

Having established our headquarters, we began to plan our scientific and artistic activities in Khotan and its vicinity. The ancient site of Khotan — ^Yotkan, where from time to time landslides revealed miscellaneous objects and remains of old structures — ^had to be explored. We also planned for a brief expedition to Mazar Imam Jafar Sadik and to the site of the Rawak stupa where shifting sands had uncovered interesting new remains.

Our Ladakis, these wonderful hillmen, found it difficult to become accustomed to new surroundings and we decided to let them return to their native Ladak. They departed, well recompensed for their splendid services. We heard later on that all of them safely reached Leh, but encountered great snowdrifts on the Sanju Pass.

Besides his archaeological work. Professor Roerich intended to extend his artistic work, possibly toward the Karanghu Tagh Mountains and round Khotan. We also were planning our future route to inner China, and had to muster a new caravan of men and animals. Amid this organizing work, clouds gathered for a storm. Our friends, of whom we had many, both among the Chinese and native Chang-t’ou, began to warn us that the Tao-t’ai had been troubled by some of his counselors, who seemed to be conspiring against our expedition. Strange rumors filled the air and no one knew whence they came or who was spreading them.

For a time, everything was quiet. The Tao-t’ai arranged a dinner of some fifty courses in honor of Professor Roerich, at which all the local officials were present, and also Mr. K. Moldavak, an Armenian gentleman, who had long been living in Khotan and was one of the closest friends of the local Governor. Mrs. Roerich could not attend the function and the whole dinner of fifty courses was sent to her by an aide to

72 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

the Governor. It was a long affair, which started about three o’clock in the afternoon and continued late into the evening. The Chinese played their usual table games, in which the loser had to drink a glass of strong Chinese brandy after each defeat. The Tao-fai entertained his guests with stories of his former exploits and showed photos of his tame leopards, of which he was very proud.

After dinner, some of the officials present sang Chinese ballads. Unfortunately none of the singers were experts, and we failed to appreciate their singing. The dinner ended late at night and we were led to the courtyard, the Governor heading the procession which was preceded by soldiers carrying Chinese paper lanterns. Our horses stood waiting for us at the inner gate of the yamen. Twenty horsemen of the Governor’s bodyguard escorted us home. Each rider carried a lantern. We rode at quick pace through the streets of Khotan which were crowded, notwithstanding the late hour. The raven black horses of the escoit shied and overthrew several fruitstands. It was a beautiful, cool evening and the usually hazy atmosphere of the desert gave way to a clear transparent sky, against the background of which we could see the sharp snowy outline of the Karanghu Tagh Mountains south of Khotan.

For several days more our relations with the authorities continued to be outwardly friendly, although there were signs of a growing uneasiness in the Governor and his subordinates.

A few days after the dinner party, the young son of the Governor became ill, and Mrs. Roerich had to go to help them. The boy recovered and the Governor afterward mentioned that this aid saved us from further difficulties in Khotan and on the way.

Khotan, a city of several scores of thousands, has not even a single doctor. The nearest European doctor lives in Yarkend. The usual practice was to send an urgent message inviting Dr. Nystrdm, of the Swedish Mission in Yarkend. It took the doctor about five days to reach Khotan, traveling day and night on a Chinese cart.

We applied to the magistrate of the city for permission to sketch and take photos in the city itself and its environs. Permission was refused in both cases, and we were told that they had written for instructions to the Governor-General of the Province. We decided to protest to the Tao-t’ai and remind him of his promise to assist the expedition in its work.

Meanwhile a new magistrate had arrived from Urumchi and Kashgar. Disquieting rumors were whispered about. The new magistrate

73 KHOTAN

was violently opposed to foreigners, although he boasted of his modernism.

A few days after his arrival, the Governor with all the Chinese officials came to thank Mrs. Roerich for her help during the illness of the Governor’s son. They came accompanied by an armed escort. From the very beginning of the conversation we felt that the Tao-t’ai and the new magistrate had something on their minds. We invited them to tea in my room and closed the doors so as to prevent the noisy soldiers from entering. Ma Tao-t’ai and the magistrate seemed very uneasy and surly. They examined the room attentively and exchanged brief remarks about our pack cases that were piled along the walls. Suddenly the Tao-t'ai coughed three times, the door swung open and the room was filled with soldiers, who lined up along the walls. The room assumed the appearance of a tribunal. We were much surprised and expressed our astonishment at the conduct of the Governor. The Tao-t’ai smiled and begged us not to pay any attention. I feel sure that the Governor was afraid to remain alone in the room.

The conversation continued on general topics, when suddenly the new magistrate began to question us about our passports. We once more produced our Peking passports sent us to India from the Chinese Wai-chiao-pu, through Mr. Cheng Lo, the Chinese Ambassador in Peking. The attitude of the Chinese was inexplainable. They scoffingly remarked that our passports were not valid in this Province, that the Peking Government had nothing to say in Hsin-chiang and that Mr. Cheng Lo had no authority to issue letters of introduction. The Chinese assumed a threatening attitude, began to gesticulate, spit on the floor, and scoff. It was quite an unexpected change, but we decided to stand firm and pointed out to them that they had no right to threaten the expedition and disregard our passports. We warned them that we should at once communicate with the British Consul in Kashgar and ask him to request the Governor-General of Hsin-chiang for permission to continue our work unimpeded. After a very heated discussion, the Tao-t’ai and his companions rose and departed for Khotan.

Mr. Chang, the new magistrate, came the next day and said that a wire had been received from the Governor-General ordering our expedition to return to India via the Sanju Pass. This was an impossibility, for the pass was long since closed by the snow, and we at once understood that the telegram was a fraud which originated in the yamen of the Governor.

74 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

The visit of the magistrate was enlivened by an episode which caused considerable merriment among our servants. The magistrate had arrived in state with a considerable escort of policemen who waited outside the house. Our Tibetan mastiff, Tumbal, as a precaution was taken away and tied to a tree in the garden. In the midst of our conversation, we suddenly heard a loud outcry followed by a wild trampling of feet. The dog had broken his chain and was slowly and menacingly advancing toward the house door. The policemen, unable to stand the sight, fled, many barricading themselves in our bathroom. The door to the room where we were sitting was open, and we could see the dog coming up the steps of the terrace. The magistrate, pale and confused, quickly got on the chair on which he had been sitting and prepared to get on the table where tea was served. It took us some time to explain to the frightened man that the dog was harmless in our presence.

After this visit of the magistrate, we sent a letter to Major Gillan, the British Consul in Kashgar, asking him to assist the expedition. The letter was sent to the Khotan post office but was returned with a note that the Tao-t^ai had given orders to seize all our correspondence with the British Consul in Kashgar. Our letters, containing telegrams for New York, Paris, and Peking, were similarly returned. The situation was a very grave one, and we were fully aware that it was the beginning of a long period of persecution, endless negotiations, and insult. We were cut off from the outside world, and had to find means to send out messages with information of our position.

Several traders volunteered to carry our letters to the consulate at Kashgar. Besides this, two friendly Kalmucks offered their services. They devised a very ingenious plan, based on their thorough acquaintance with local official carelessness. Their plan consisted in waiting patiently with the letter in the street outside the post office. At the very last moment, when the postal messenger would be leading out his horse and fixing the saddlebags, one of the Kalmucks would step out and hand our letter addressed in Turki and Chinese to the British Consul. The Chinese postal official dispatching the mail, would angrily ejaculate, “Why are you always late?” and without looking at the address would throw the letter into one of the saddlebags. This stratagem invariably worked and our letters reached their destination. Evidently at Kashgar our letters were promptly delivered. It took us sixteen days to get an answer, which usually came through a private channel.

On December 29, 1925, the new magistrate and several minor mili-

75 KHOTAN

tary officers, representing the Tao-^ai, came to search our baggage and house. We were said to possess a huge amount of ammunition and some kind of a “shooting wheel” with which we were able to annihilate the whole of the Khotan garrison and the population in less than ten minutes! Our square wooden boxes of preserves from the Cockburn Agency in Kashmir gave rise to the suspicion that we carried large supplies of ammunition with us. Our firearms, consisting of two rifles, one double-barreled gun and three revolvers, and one case of ammunition, were sealed and taken away. Professor Roerich, in his book, Altai-Himdaya, has given a detailed description of the ridiculous and fruitless search.

We decided to leave Khotan at once and go to Kashgar in order to negotiate by wire with the Governor-General for permission to proceed with our work. We also desired the return of our firearms, without which we could not attempt to cross the brigand-infested regions of the interior of China. The authorities gave their silent assent and we hired a camel caravan to carry our baggage to Kashgar. Once more the courtyard of the house and garden were filled with men and kneeling camels — ^a welcome sight to every explorer.

On January i everything was ready for the start, when suddenly an official from the Tao-t’ai arrived and coolly informed us, “The Tao-t’ai orders you to go to Tun-huang in Kansu and not through Kashgar.” We tried to argue, pointing out the fact that our only firearms had been seized, that money orders were waiting for us at the Chinese post office in Kashgar, that we were expecting answers to our cables. All our words were of no avail, the man only repeated one and the same sentence, “Ma Ta-jen changed his mind, and orders your expedition to proceed through the desert to Tun-huang.” He added, however, that we should go and speak to the Tao-t’ai personally. And so we went. A long and tedious conference followed, during which we persistently tried to obtain a written statement explaining the Tao-t’ai's actions. We sat at a small table facing the Tao-t’ai and could see his soldiers behind him making grimaces and pointing their fingers at the Tao-t’ai’s head.

The Tao-t’ai was adamant in his decision to keep us in Khotan. It is difficult to say what had influenced his change of attitude. Some said that he was possessed by the spirit of the murdered Ti-t’ai of Kashgar and no longer could control himself. Others repeated the story that someone had sowed mistrust in the Tao-t’ai’s mind. Whatever it might

76 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

be, it was clear that the situation was a very serious one and that we had to find a solution.

We returned to our headquarters and drafted a letter to the Consul in Kashgar, informing him of the situation and requesting him to communicate with the Governor-General in Urumchi. From now on, we received frequent visits from Mr. Chang, magistrate of Khotan. Each day he had another astounding telegram to produce, ordering our immediate arrest and deportation. It so happened that every time he came we were able to confront him with a letter from Major Gillan or a telegram from America. Friends were acting to help us leave Khotan.

Our days were spent either working at the headquarters or negotiating with local authorities. These negotiations occupied most of the time, for each visit of the Governor or the magistrate meant five or six hours of continuous conversation.

On January 20 we received a welcome letter from Major Gillan, notifying us that following his efforts the Governor-General had sent immediate orders for our release from Khotan. This was a piece of welcome news and all in the expedition headquarters rejoiced at the prospect of a march to Kashgar.

On the evening of the same day, we received the visit of our friend Khudai Berdi Bai, who brought the news that a letter had been received from Urumchi with permission to travel to Kashgar. This was an unprecedented case — that an order from the Governor-General should be announced through a private person. The Governor “lost face” and could not deliver the order personally or through the magistrate. The authorities kept silent. Only the commander of the garrison and the old amban sent us their visiting cards with good wishes for our trip to Kashgar. A military officer with the rank of shao-wei or lieutenant came and inquired about the day of our departure. He was ordered to furnish a guard of mounted soldiers to accompany us to Yarkend. The Chinese seemed uneasy, and somehow conscious of the wrong committed toward the expedition. The actions of the local Khotan authorities had almost completely prevented us from carrying out our plans.

We hurried with our preparations. Most of the baggage had been packed long ago. We now only needed to engage a trustworthy caravan-bashi. Khudai Berdi Bai recommended us to Temur Bai, a wealthy caravaneer owning many horse caravans transporting goods between Khotan and Leh. Temur Bai undertook to furnish us with seventy-four pack horses for six Chinese dollars each, with the understanding that

77 KHOTAN

we should reach Kashgar on the fourteenth day. Besides pack anima ls we were obliged to hire two Chinese carriages or ma-fa at twenty-five dollars for the journey. In one of the carriages our Chinese interpreter Ts’ai had to travef, together with a case of firearms, which were returned to us sealed on the eve of our departure. Poor Ts’ai had taken to opium smoking, no doubt depressed by the insulting attitude of the local officials. The aged man was full of his old-time dignity and complained bitterly against the revolting methods of the local administration. As a result of the opium, he was so weak that he could not keep himself in the saddle and had to travel in the carriage. He was careful to conceal his habit and smoked only in the dark of the night.

In the second carriage our Tibetan mastiff, Tumbal, traveled in charge of a servant.

The three months of detention came to an end and we were looking forward to new regions. Our courtyard was filled with friendly Chang-t’ou who came to say goodbye to the expedition. During our three months’ detention we had made many trusted friends; it is a pleasure to express here our gratitude to all who assisted the expedition during the difficult winter days in Khotan.

### KHOTAN-KASHGAR

IV

KHOTAN-KASHGAR

IN the early morning of January 28, 1926, our courtyard and garden were crowded with pack horses and caravan men in heavy sheepskins and dark red charuqs — ^a scene familiar to anyone who has traveled in the caravan region of Asia. The bustle was great and it took us five hours to start the baggage caravan marching. The tents and the rest of the camp equipment had to go in advance, and for this purpose the best horses were given to the camp detachment. This detachment had to leave camp last, and arrive at the new camp first. The caravan men, mostly Turki from Khotan, were sadly lacking in initiative and performed their tasks with surprising carelessness.

Most of the pack horses were big animals from Yarkend, capable of carrying about two hundred pound loads. Their general condition was good and we could hope to arrive in Kashgar on time. The Turkestan pack saddle is much superior to the wooden pack saddles of Ladak and Tibet. It consists of two thick saddle cloths, on which is fixed the saddle cushion — U-shaped and made of sheepskin or cloth well stuffed with straw. The load is fixed to the saddle by ropes, made of camel’s or sheep’s wool. Travelers are warned not to use hemp ropes of Chinese or European make, for they are apt to cause sores. Ropes made of camel’s wool are very good; those made out of sheep’s wool are much inferior.

Several mounted soldiers in charge of an aged shao-wei or lieutenant were ordered to escort us as far as Yarkend, the next garrisoned oasis along the southern trade route. They all came and lined up in front of the house, the lieutenant holding the red visiting card of his superior officer in his raised hand. All the men were over fifty, and were dressed in voluminous gray coats and fur caps with large earflaps which, if necessary, could be buttoned in front of the face. Their arms consisted of old Mausers, and the officer had an old Chinese sword. We were much surprised at the age of these warriors, and inquired whether they intended to retire from service. The reply was that they had recently been promoted to the cavalry for gallant service! In Hsin-chiang a young soldier has to serve in infantry units, and only after he has passed an age

82 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

limit or distinguished himself in service is he promoted to the grade of a mounted soldier or ma-p’ing. In Hsin-chiang, as in many other parts of China, a horse is only a means of transportation; a Chinese trooper is taught to sit on a horse, but never to ride it. A beg from Karakash and two daroghas were also delegated to attend to our needs on the journey. They were directed to accompany us to Guma Bazaar, the nearest administrative center on the Khotan-Yarkend route.

We started only about noon, and rapidly rode through the Mohammedan and Chinese sections of Khotan. It was a bazaar day and the streets were thronged with a multicolored crowd of villagers. Our first stage was Zawa. The baggage caravan arrived late at night and we were obliged to spend several hours waiting for it in the garden of the official resthouse. The night was cool and we warmed ourselves at a huge camp fire made by the local villagers.

Before starting from Khotan, our Chinese interpreter, Ts’ai ssu-yeh, had made a yellow flag marked with our name abbreviated to “Lo,” stating the official designation of the expedition. This flag was intrusted to a darogha, who galloped ahead of us and planted the flag on the spot selected for our camp.

In Zawa we found the flag planted on the roof of the resthouse. Ts’ai ssu-yeh was very wise to prepare this flag, for it saved us from many troubles with petty officials, who were always found to respect it even more than our Peking passports.

In the evening we discovered that our soldiers and some of our Chinese servants were confirmed opium smokers. In the morning they were late getting up and considerably handicapped the work about the camp. An opium smoker is a great calamity in an expedition camp and we decided to avail ourselves of the next opportunity to get rid of them.

The route from Zawa to Pialma has already been described in this volume. A brief halt was made at the Shrine Kum-rabat Padshahim. The modern Mohammedan shrine is situated on the spot of an ancient temple dedicated to sacred rats, built by a king of Khotan to commemorate his victory over the Hiung-nu, in which he was miraculously assisted by rats which destroyed the ammunition of the enemies.*

After the Pigeon Shrine, the trail left the sand dune belt and followed a broad gravel plain. A brief halt was made again to water the

animals at Ak-langar — a desert resthouse built in the days of Yakub Beg. The resthouse has a well of brackish water.

Pialma, the terminal oasis on the Duwa River, was reached late at night. The stars shone brilliantly when we entered the village. The camp was pitched in a garden belonging to the house of a wealthy landowner. There was a scarcity of drinking water, as all the water supply had dried up, and we were obliged to thaw the snow. The horses had to be watered at a place four miles distant.

Late in the evening we had a visit from Dr. Nystrom, of the Swedish Mission in Yarkend. He was hurrying to Khotan where two officers of the Governor’s bodyguard had recently wounded each other. One of the men died shortly after the shooting, but the other recovered and was subsequently executed by order of the Governor. Dr. Nystrom was traveling day and night in a Chinese cart, halting once in twenty-four horns to feed the horses.

The march from Pialma to Zanguya led over a gravel desert. We instructed the darogha, who daily galloped ahead of us with a notice of our arrival, to prepare quarters for us in houses of well-to-do villagers and to avoid Chinese official resthouses with their noise and squalor.

Shortly after our arrival in Zanguya, the lieutenant in charge of our guard arrived and requested me to look at their horses which had become unexpectedly ill. We found the animals lying in the stable, unable to stand on their feet. The fat animals, which were always kept in the stable and never given exercise, had succumbed to the fatigues of three days’ marching. It was evident that they could go no farther and had to be left in Zanguya. I therefore advised the distressed lieutenant to hire horses from local peasants and to leave his own horses in charge of a soldier. He followed my advice and on the next morning he and his men were mounted on shaggy creatures with tremendous manes and tails. The local bronchos probably had seldom been ridden before and the escort had an exciting ride to Guma Bazaar. This is an important center with some seven hundred houses and the seat of a magistrate, who controls the vast mountain tracts around Sanju Oasis. It is renowned for its numerous orchards and mulberry groves. Its chief local industry is the manufacture of coarse paper. A spacious garden with a summer house was reserved for our camp. The gates of the garden were gaily decorated with red and yellow cloth and a group of local notables was waiting inside the garden.

Soon after our arrival, we received the visit of the local magistrate.

84 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

He was accompanied by his young son and a troop of armed policemen in strange uniforms and old muzzle-loading rifles. The magistrate was greatly concerned over our difBculties in Khotan and hinted that Ma Tao-yin was a man of dangerous habits. An authentic source had told him the story that the Governor of Khotan had stormed our headquarters and that he was repelled with heavy losses. How this story originated, it was impossible to learn. Rumors take strange shapes in Chinese Turkestan.

Our servant T’ang, who had fallen ill a few days before, had to be left in care of the local magistrate, who promised to send him back to Khotan, as soon as he should feel better. T’ang was a confirmed opium smoker and the last four days of marching through the desert had completely broken down his reserve strength.

In the evening we were visited by a traveling troop of actors. The tamasha or theatrical entertainment was illumined with torchlights and Chinese paper lanterns. Most of the actors were local Turki, but the subjects of the scenes and the songs were Chinese. These tamasha are a feature of Turkestan life.

At Guma, we were given another beg and darogha to accompany us to Karghalik. Our original plan was to camp at Cholak-langar, some eighteen miles from Guma, but fresh arrivals at Guma brought the news that the water supply at Cholak had completely dried up. We had to camp at Siligh-langar, some ten miles west of Guma. Siligh-langar consisted of several miserable mud hovels with a small inclosed courtyard filled with piles of firewood and bundles of hay. At night a large camel caravan bound for Tun-huang passed our camp and almost overturned some. of our tents. The night was pitch dark and the camel drivers were sound asleep in their saddles. The droning sound of bells heralded the approach of the caravan column, marching at good pace. Before we were able to realize what was happening the dark silhouette of the huge caravan had entered our camp and the camels’ feet were tearing our tent ropes. The energetic action of some of our men alone prevented further damage and a stampede of frightened animals.

Our next stop was Akin-langar, another relay station on the long thirty-four mile stage between Guma and Karghalik. So far we had enjoyed perfect weather, with warm days and cool nights. At Akin-langar the weather suddenly changed. A cold wind started up toward sunset and the temperature dropped below zero. Snow fell during the night and in the morning we found the desert covered by a thin layer of

85 KHOTAN-KASHGAR

snow. The day was dull and heavy clouds hovered over the graveled expanse of the desert. A bitterly cold northwest wind made progress difficult and we were relieved when we entered the cultivation zone of Besh-arik.

The city of Karghalik did not impress us as an important center. It is situated on one of the branches of the Tiznaf darya and through it passes the important Kokyar-Karakorum trade route. Most of the caravan owners on the Leh-Yarkend route are natives of Karghalik. The town was suffering from a scarcity of drinking water and we found the population breaking ice in a dirty pool in the very center of the bazaar. The local magistrate had arranged quarters for us in an official resthouse, but it was too small for such a large party as ours. We accordingly moved out and camped in a garden belonging to a well-to-do landowner. In the evening another group of actors entertained us with a tamasha, followed by a performance of two Chinese jugglers who demonstrated their art with swords and spears, handling the heavy swords with remarkable dexterity. It was late at night when we returned to our tents.

In the morning we experienced considerable difficulty with relay horses for our soldiers and camp servants. Strange to say, the soldiers always appealed to us in case of difficulty. That morning they were unable to find saddle horses, and we had to intervene for them with the local beg. After prolonged shouting and beating, during which two men were, severely lashed by an infuriated headman, the horses were produced and our caravan started for Posgam.

At Posgam we encountered a group of Shikarpuri money lenders and several traders from Hoshiarpur, who led us to the private house of the local ming-bashi. The wooden carvings on the columns strikingly reminded me of the ancient fragments of wood carvings discovered by Sir Aurel Stein during his explorations in the ancient sites along the southern trade route. These Turkestan carvings closely resemble some of the wood carvings found in the old churches of South Russia. This particular style must have once had an immense spread along the greatest highway of Asia, passing through the belt of steppe and desert Country and stretching from the Carpathian Mountains to the Great Wall of China.

On February 6, we started very early in order to reach Yarkend in the forenoon. Some five miles from Posgam, we met a servant of the Ladak aqsaqal who sent us a message inviting us to stay in his sum-

86 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA

met house situated in the suburb of Yarkend — ^an invitation which we gladly accepted. We crossed the Yarkend darya on rafts. It took us fully two hours to bring across our saddle horses and the detachment of pack horses with the camping outfit. We hurried to Yarkend through dusty lanes lined with toghral^s or desert poplars on either side.

The house of the Ladak aqsaqcd, Abdul Razak, proved an ideal place for our stay in Yarkend. It was clean and had a spacious garden with roomy courtyards and good stables. The owner had a very fluent knowledge of Lhasan Tibetan, having spent several years of his life in Lhasa. His family enjoyed a considerable reputation in the trading world of central Asia. His eldest brother was aqsaqcd in Kashgar, another was aqsaqal in Leh, and a third one was at the head of a big trading establishment in distant Lhasa. The aqsaqal’s assistance proved invaluable to us. We spent the evening with the aqsaqcd, who possessed a vast experience with tribes and different regions of central Asia. The morning of the next day was occupied by official visits to the local authorities.

Yarkend impressed us as being a much more active and thriving place than Khotan. It is the chief entrepdt of Indian and Afghan trade and its roofed bazaars and chaiXhaneh or restaurants were thronged by different nationalities. Yarkend is the largest oasis in the country. It is well watered by irrigation channels and has an extensive cultivation of rice, which is exported to Khotan and Kashgar. Besides rice, the oasis produces corn, wheat, barley, cotton, flax, hemp, sesamum, and tobacco. According to recent official estimates, the population of the oasis is over 200,000. The Mohammedan town or Kone-shahr is surrounded by a brick wall with several towers. The Han-ch’eng or Chinese section lies to the northwest of the native quarter. The Afghan Government maintains a consul at Yarkend who, although not recognized by the Chinese as such, supervises the Afghan colony and its interests in the oasis. The most costly products of Afghan export are opium and Badakhshani horses. The trade is clandestine and the offenders are usually punished. For the past few years the export of Badakhshani horses has been prohibited by the Amir, and Afghan traders, traveling to Chinese Turkestan or elsewhere, have to sign a document that they will return to the country with their horses. Notwithstanding these strict measures, Badakhshani horses are constantly seen on the Yarkend market, the horse trade being carried on through Kirghiz traders.

Most of the Yarkend trade is conducted with India and the Indian

colony is the largest foreign colony in the oasis. The Chinese local authorities did their best to assist us with relay horses and travel arrangements. The local magistrate, a Cantonese by birth, was a superior type of ofl&cial, keen to interest himself in the objects of geographical and archaeological research. The magistrate assured us that letters about our coming were received from Peking and that he could not understand the attitude of the Khotan authorities; according to him, Ma Ta-jen had become insane after the shooting at Kashgar.

After our official calls, we paid a visit to the Swedish Mission which occupies a spacious compound, inside which are situated the Mission church, school buildings, hospital, and quarters for the members of the Mission. It was our first touch with Europe after six months of travel in Ladak, Karakorum, and Khotan.

In the afternoon we received the return visit of the local magistrate who came accompanied by a detachment of cavalry, armed with Russian rifles and swords. The White Russian troops, retreating into Hsin-chiang, had left behind them a vast amount of arms and ammunition; and at the time of our visit, the Chinese troops in the Province were all armed with Russian weapons. The magistrate was very much interested in Professor Roerich’s paintings, and showed a fine appreciation of paintings on Chinese subjects.

The busy day was followed by a quiet evening. The Chinese escort from Khotan came to take leave, and each man received a present of three dollars. They expressed their desire to continue their service with the expedition and insisted that we should write to the Governor-General about it. Their place was taken by a guard of black-turbaned soldiers from the local garrison.

It was a beautifully clear morning when we started from Yarkend. The snowy mountains west and northwest of the Yarkend Oasis were clearly visible against the pale background of the sky. There, beyond the snowy ramparts, lay the uplands of the great Pamirs and a fascinating border country, visited by only a few chosen ones.

Our first stage led past the cultivated fields and hamlets of Yarkend Oasis. We reached Kok-rabat early in the day. A large crowd of local peasants surrounded the camp and dispersed only at dusk. Some strange rumors had reached the village and local people were anxious to see the newcomers. Next day we were in Kizil Bazaar — a half-ruined village with a vast desert plain called Karakum or “Black Sands.” The

next stage to Yangi-hissar lay across a desert country intersected by hamlets with small patches of cultivation.

We reached Yangi-hissar late in the afternoon and were warmly welcomed by Dr. Anderson and his family. We spent the evening with the hospitable missionaries in an enlightening conversation on the conditions of life in the Province, and the vast mineral resources of the country round Yangi-hissar and the mountain tracts west of the oasis.

The distance from Yangi-hissar to Yapchan was covered in six hours. The proximity of a big thriving center began to be felt along the route. The traffic had considerably increased; long trains of Chinese carts loaded with merchandise, and numerous riders, were constantly passing our column. Yapchan is a considerable village and the last stage before Kashgar. We camped outside the village in a field, and an inquisitive but well-behaved crowd of native Turki stood watching us at a distance. A small boy with a native stringed instrument visited our camp and sang folk songs, many of which were composed in the days of the ill-fated Yakub Beg.

On the next day, February 12, our caravan men were up long before dawn and through the door of the tent one could see the camp fires in the dark and the burly figures of men taking their morning meal. It was the last day for Temur Bai’s caravan and he and his men were anxious to reach Kashgar early in the day. We overtook our baggage train which was already well on its way toward Kashgar.

Not far from the Kashgar bridge we were greeted by several chaprassis or orderlies in scarlet uniforms, with a note from Major Gillan of the British consulate inviting us to luncheon. Outside the Chinese city we again met several riders who proved to be local begs and daroghas, sent from the Tao-yin yamen of Kashgar to welcome us.

We rode straight to the consulate, where we received a friendly welcome from Major and Mrs. Gillan. It was strange to behold our dusty selves in the civilized surroundings of a western home. The consulate, overlooking the Tumen River, has an ideal situation and commands a good view of its banks. Our first day in Kashgar passed in conversation. We had to relate the story of all our difficulties in Khotan and discuss our future plans. A telegram had to be sent to the Governor-General in Urumchi announcing our arrival in Kashgar, and Mr. George Chu, late interpreter with the Chinese Labor Corps in France during the Great War and now Chinese secretary to the consulate, promised

89 KHOTAN-KASHGAR

to interview the KLashgar Tao-yin and Mr. M. Y. Tao, his foreign secretary, with the view of obtaining necessary permissions for us.

We established our headquarters in the spacious buildings of the Russo-Asiatic Bank, kindly put at the disposal of the expedition by the directors of the local branch.

The Consul and all the European residents were of the opinion that it was absolutely necessary for us to go to Urumchi and negotiate with the Governor-General personally. This meant quite a change in our previous plans — instead of Tun-huang and Kansu, Urumchi and the country north of the T’ien Shan Mountains. The force of circumstance is often greater than the will of man. The Province of Hsin-chiang was agitated by a smoldering unrest, and the Hsin-chiang-Kansu border was reported to be in a state of war. Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang was said to be advancing through Kansu Province and Ma Ch’i, Chinese High Commissioner in Sining, was joining forces with him. The atmosphere was charged with anxiety and people were wondering whether the ill-disciplined troops of Yang Tseng-hsin would be able to check the advance of Feng’s army.

Kashgar is the true capital of Hsin-chiang south of the T’ien Shan Mountains. Before the revolution of 1917, it was the chief emporium of trade with Russian Turkestan. The virtual closing of the Russian border during the period of the Civil War had diverted trade to India across the difficult mountain route of the Karakorum. During our stay in Kashgar, the Irkeshtam route to Russian Turkestan was said to be reopening for trade and a steady stream of caravans and traders turned westward along the centuries-old route. Most of the horse caravans in Kashgar had been hired to ship goods from Kashgar to Andijan and we experienced some difficulty in finding horses for our further journey.

The thronged bazaars of Kashgar and the vast amount of European, Indian, and Chinese goods displayed in the shops attested the great commercial interchange of the oasis.

Every morning we went for a stroll or a ride in the Kashgar streets and bazaars. In the early hours of the morning, before the dust haze had enveloped the horizon, we could clearly see the Kashgar Range southwest of the city, towering from a height of some 18,000 feet to more than 25,000 feet. The city with its gardens and plantations of rice along the banks of the Tumen River and the background of snowy mountains presented a typical picture of a central Asian town.

The Kashgar bazaars, roofed with sacking and straw mats, were full of attractions to the visitor. These narrow, dark streets were a genuine ethnographical museum in which the student reveled in searching for new types. Here was a dark shop with Bukhara and Khiva wares and Samarkand carpets. A dark-bearded Andijani merchant sat among his colorfully ornamented coffers; these remind one of the early Renaissance coffers in Italy. The wonderful period of the early Italian Renaissance had many links with the countries of the distant Orient. In another shop a white-bearded Afghan offered the products of his native land and Indian spices. His neighbor was a Chinese trader selling large Chinese spectacles with massive frames. Unfortimately these old-time spectacles give way nowadays to the far more practical snow goggles from India. In remote parts of central Asia, the large Chinese spectacles are one of the attributes of official standing and Kirghiz and Mongol princes and headmen always wear them, regardless of whether they need them or not.

The next shop was a true monetary museum. The owner kept in stock various coins and banknotes from a dozen different countries. Indian rupees, old Russian rubles, different Chinese taels, and banknotes issued by the various regional governments of the time of the Russian Civil War — ^all were represented on the shelves and in the iron coffers of the shop. After the Russian revolution and the depreciation of the ruble, local traders had bought at low prices a tremendous amount of imperial Russian gold rubles and banknotes of different issues, with the hope that they might sometime regain their original value. -They are all millionaires so far as the number of banknotes are concerned, and curiously enough they count these mythical millions in theh business transactions. The next shop presented something quite out of the ordinary. The owner of this establishment specialized in a variety of uniforms, among which generals’ uniforms with huge golden epaulets and a profusion of gold crown lace were prominent. Some of the local officials and Kirghiz headmen are said to be very fond of these queer attires. Among the exhibited uniforms, I found one of a Russian high school student and wondered whence it had come and to what mountain ail or nomad encampment it would ultimately find its way to bewilder a future explorer.

Kashgar boasts of a carriage factory which supplies covered carriages of an antiquated pattern to all officials throughout the vast Dominion. These strange looking carriages are usually painted in bright colors.
