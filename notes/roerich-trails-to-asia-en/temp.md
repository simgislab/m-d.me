**30 TRAILS TO INMOST ASIA**

that the dolichocephalic population had been preserved along the Tibetan border, whereas the center of the country had been conquered at some early date by a brachycephalic race. I am inclined to think that the graves at Teu-gser-po were left by the ancient stratum of dolichocephalic tribes of Tibet. It is interesting to note that the Leh graves are popularly called "nomad graves," and it is precisely among the nomad population that we find the dolichocephalic type with fine features and straight hair. Unfortunately the missionaries were obliged to stop their excavations and a great many of these graves are still unexplored. It will be very instructive to compare the Ladak graves to the analogous graves foimd in the lake region north of the Trans-Himalayas.

The famous Hemis Monastery has often been described in books about the country, and the religious dances that take place at the monastery about the end of June have been attended by many Europeans. Although of comparatively recent date, the monastery contains some old bronzes. The frescoes in the temples are modern, and as such have only an iconographical value.

The road along the Indus Valley is extremely picturesque. The vivid green of its fields appears in sharp contrast to the ruggedness of its mountains. The village of Shel on the right bank of the river was once the capital of the Ladak Kingdom and is notable for ancient rock inscriptions and stone-cut images. The Yellow Hat Monastery of Tik-tse (Khrig-rtse), situated on a steep crag, is interesting for its romantic situation, but it looks forlorn. It is populated by a crowd of dirty and insolent monks, who impudently clamor for bahjhish and lack' the discipline and monastic dignity found in their colleagues of Spi-thug and Ri-dzong. The Incarnate Lama was obliged to quit the monastery some years ago, for monastic life possessed no attractions for him. A new incarnation did not appear, and the whole establishment was left to itself. We succeeded in finding some old bronzes and several old painted banners. Some of the temple doors had interesting wood carvings. The colossal figure of the Future Buddha, lit by numerous offering lamps, made a powerful impression; but the heaps of rubbish in the corners of the edifice and the thick layer of dust on objects of worship only enhanced the first sense of the forlorn state of the monastery. No doubt many interesting objects could be found, but the state of utter disorganization prevents the student from making a careful inspection of the monastery buildings.

The autumn was rapidly setting in. Yellow leaves in the gardens ana
