В 1902 Цыбиков и Норзунов уже в России. В 1903 РГО издает альбом фото Ц&Н в количестве 50 шт. (29 фото Норзунова, 21 --- Цыбикова). К альбому прилагается текст с описаниями фото «Виды Центрального Тибета». Далее в 1904 этот альбом с сопроводительным письмом Григорьева на английском РГО рассылает крупным географическим обществам. Письмо озаглавлено «Views of Great Tibet» и включает описания каждого фото составленные Цыбиковым с коллегами. Из письма:

## Views of Great Tibet

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021667924/>

The fifty plates of this collection, reproducing views
of Lhasa and of some other places of interest in
Central Tibet, are enlargements from negatives made in
1900 and 1902, on behalf of the Imperial Russian Geo-
graphical Society, by Mr Ovshe Norzunov and Mr Gombo-
ch'jab Ts'ibikov.

Both gentlements are lamaists; Norzunov - a kalmyk
of the Astrakhan horde and Tsi'bikov - a K'ori Buriat.
Both had hand cameras called  "Self-worker" by Pipon
in Paris, supplied with Anastigmatic lenses by Goerz
Lenses III, N 00. The size of the original negatives is 9x6 1/2
centimeters.

Norzunov \[marked further \[N.\]\] used "Lumiere" plates, Ts'i-
bikov (marked further (Z.)) - "Empress" plates of "The Bri-
tannia Works".

The explanations of the plates have beed given by
Mr. Ts'ibikov and by some other Buriats and Kalmuks
well acquainted with the sacred sites of Central Tibet.

Most of the Tibetan names are given in the translite-
ration used in L. Austin Waddell's "Buddhism in Tibet or
Lamaism" ???? 1895 and those not to be found in that
book have been transcribed, on the same principles, as
nearly as it could be done phonetically as the names
were pronounced by the informants.

**N 1. Lhasa' from the East \[N.\]**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670590/>

In the background and nearly in the center is the

**2**

"Iron mountain" Ch'agpo ri 1) with the Man-ba Ta-ts'an 2),
where Tibetan medicine was taught.

On the right is the hill Marpori with Potala, Dalai
Lama's Palace.

To the left of Ch'agpo ri, behind a white building, one
has a rather faint view of Lhasa's cathedral, the Jowo-
k'an 3).

The buildings in the foreground are those of Banak sho 4),
the traders quarter.

**N 2. Lhasa from the North \[N.\]**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670636/>

The large dark building behind a white one in the
Foreground is the Gah-ldan K'an-sar 1), up to 1751 palace
of the Tibetan kings, mentioned only by Fra Cassiano
(Beligatti) da Macerata 2) and Sarat Chandra Das. 3)
More to the right is the (gilded) roof of Ramo-ch'e

In chinese style.

Obs. 1) Kang-da Khang Sar Waddell's Plan of Lhasa

2) Giornale di Fra Cassiano etc. edited by A. Magna
ghi in the Rivista Geografica Italiana. Vol VIII and IX
From 1901 and 1902 where the palace in question is named
"Kande Kanzer" (Vol. IX. p. 244 ) and "Kande Kansar" (Vol.
IX p. 314). See also note (2) on p. 244 of A. Magnaghi's
paper l. c. where the palace in question, on the authority
of Oragio Della Penna, is named Kaden Khansar.

3) Sarat Chandra Das l. c. p. 172 spells the name
of the palace "Gadan-Khangsar"

**N 3. Marpo ri with the Potala from SSE****. \[N.\]**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670614/>

**N 4. Ditto, from a nearest point of view and more from
the West****. \[N.\]**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670629/>

**N 5. Potala from the South. \[N.\]**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670631/>

The large dark (de facto red) building on the top of
The hill is the "Phodang Marpo" or the "Red Palace" of Sarat
Chandra Das 1).

The main southern entrance to the palace is in the
white building in the foreground.

To the left (on the picture) of the main entrance and
In front of it is in an enclosure a dark (de facto yellow) pa-
vilion over a "pei" dating from 1794 and standing on a
stone tortoise 2).

To the right of the main entrance is a similar dark
(yellow) pavilion over a stone tablet standing on a square
Stone pedestal; dating from 1721 3)

**4**

The (monolith) column seen near the right pavilion
bears an illegible inscription in Tibetan.
Inside the walls, to the right (on the picture) of the main
Entrance is the mint.

Obs. 1) l. c.p. 166

2) Rockhill l. c. p. 264 footnote (1)

3) Rockhill l. c. p. 187 footnote (2) and page 264 footnote (1).

**N 6. Potala from SSW. (Z.)**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670608/>

This view has been taken by Ts'ibikov during the fes-
tival he calls "Ts'og Ch'od" 1) celebrated on the 29th day
of the second moon of the (Tibetan) year (18/5 April 1901).

The huge pictures hung on the palace wall beneath
the Nam-gyal Ch'oid, the monastery of the palace, re-
present Jakya Muni (on the right ???) and Tara or Doma
(on the left).

Crowds of people cover the slope of the hill and stand
at the foot of the picture.

Obs. 1) Sung ch'o Rockhill l. c. p. 8 footnote.

**N 7. Potala from the East. \[N.\]**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670620/>

**N 8. Potala from NNE. \[N.\]**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670638/>

On the roof of Phodang Marpo are seen four shrines
with (gilded) roofs in chinese fashion.

Half-way up hill is a low round towerlike building
where those coming on horseback to the palace the
western way up, dismount and leave their horses and
mules.

**5**

The entrance to the Palace from that side is facing
the East, in the tower which we see on the right hand cor-
ner (from the spectator) of the Palace.

On A-K's Plan of Lhasa is a lapsus calami: instead
of a north-eastern way up Marpori there ought to be
??? leaving the western slope of the hill up to the
north-western corner of the Palace. This way is plainly
seen in the next pictures.

The dark lines radiating from as many apertures
at the base of the walls of the Palace are streambeds
of excrements.

**N 9. Potala from WNW. \[N.\]**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670621/>

View taken from the road to Drepung monastery.
The birds seen on the ground are but cocks brought
thither from all Lhasa. The cocks are ???? in great
numbers  in the household, but, as in the precincts of the
ritualistic outer circumambulation road to creature
can be put to death, the cocks are carried to this place
where they are left to te mercy of passers-by and those
making the circumambulations; they feed the birds
by throwing them corn.

Obs. May be also that by bringing hither
cocks is acted the life saving charity or the
"Srog slu" rite which on the authority of Sarat
Chandra Das (l. c. p. 134)  is calculated to ensure
life of the donor.

**N 10. A Lhasa street during the "Ts'og Ch'od." (Z.)**

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670633/>

The stripes flying in the wind are prayer flags.

<https://www.loc.gov/item/2021670594/>

This is Demu-Khutukhtu's, or late regent (+ August 1900)
monastic palace.

roofed building on the foreground being a private house.
On the almost left is a group of Dar-c'og (prayer-
flags).

A ch'orten like gate between Ch'agpo ri and Mar-
po ri. The view is taken on the way from Lhasa.
The large two-storied house to the right is a pri-

From the top of the ch'orten wires are stretched
to the tops of two smaller ch'ortens standing on both
hills of the passage; there wires are furnished with small bells.
One of the smaller ch'ortens is seen to the left through
the branches of a tree.

The other small ch'orten (on the slope of Mapro ri) is
seen on the view of Potala facing p. 166 Sarat Chandra
